  There are some known issues relating to the move to Qt 5, we will work to address these in future releases. The main issues relate to rendering artifacts/problems on Mac OS X, as this is the first release to feature Qt 5 we would appreciate your feedback on any additional issues you might encounter.

  The tomviz project is developed as part of a collaboration between Kitware and Cornell University under DOE Office of Science contract DE-SC0011385. This is a community project, and we are very pleased to take input and contributions from all in the community.
