  Kitware announced its involvement in the Scalable Data Management,  Analysis, and Visualization (SDAV) Institute, supported by the U.S.  Department of Energy’s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing  (

  ) program.  The project will be led by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and is a  collaboration between prominent government laboratory, university, and  industry partners for the purpose of creating a comprehensive set of  tools and techniques that are essential for knowledge discovery on the  DOE’s various computing platforms over the next five years.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The SDAV Institute’s primary goals are to actively work with  application teams and assist them in achieving breakthrough science; and  to provide technical solutions in data management, analysis, and  visualization, all of which are broadly used by the computational  science community. Such expertise is required to address the  ever-increasing size, scale, complexity, and richness of scientific  data.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Current users of DOE computing systems are faced with managing and  analyzing their datasets for knowledge discovery, and must frequently  rely on antiquated tools more appropriate for the teraflop era. While  new techniques for interpreting large data have been developed, many in  the field believe that these new algorithms and implementations will not  work on their systems as we move into the many-core era. Without  addressing these issues and beliefs, there will be a widening gap  between computational and I/O capacity.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The SDAV Institute will work with DOE researchers to develop a  comprehensive approach that will address these issues by encompassing  all the stages of data analysis from initial data generation,  orchestration of analysis tasks, and effective visualization of the  results.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  “We are extremely pleased to be part of the SDAV Institute,” said  Berk Geveci, Kitware’s Principal Investigator on  this project. “The aims of the Institute will greatly impact the  computational science community while accelerating the pace of new  discoveries.”
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Kitware’s role is to support the DOE’s scientific teams with  large-scale data analysis and visualization. This will involve making  enhancements and extensions to current tools, such as ParaView and  VisIt; introducing and supporting new technologies leveraging many-core  and multi-core architectures; and coupling data analysis capability with  simulation codes for in-situ analysis and co-processing.
