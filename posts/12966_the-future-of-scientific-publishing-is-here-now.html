  Enough of criticizing the decadent
  <strong>
   Conferences
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Journals
  </strong>
  that insist on using obsolete practices unfit for the Digital Age.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of ranting about them, this time, let’s take a look at the
  <strong>
   progressive
  </strong>
  Journals that are the
  <strong>
   Future of Scientific Publishing.

  <strong>
   celebrate
  </strong>
