    ITK Meets OpenCV at CVPR 2011
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  At this year’s CVPR conference, Kitware presented a half-day tutorial on the combined use of ITK and OpenCV. Luis Ibanez, Patrick Reynolds, Matt Leotta, Gabe Hart, and Amitha Perera led the half-lecture, half- training session, as well as presented some recent work on directly supporting video in ITK; this work was developed under funding from the U.S. National Library of Medicine as part of the current effort to improve and extend ITK.

  Will Schroeder, Luis Ibanez, and Marcus Hanwell attended OSCON 2011 in Portland, Oregon in July. Will and Marcus were included on a panel “Practicing Open Science” with Brian Wylie of Sandia National Labs. The panel was organized into three parts: open science practices and introduction, growing an open science program, and open science in government. Throughout the event Kitware held discussions and talks with many individuals and groups regarding potential collaboration and future projects.

    Desktop Summit 2011
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  In early August, Marcus Hanwell arrived in Berlin, Germany to attend Desktop Summit 2011, where he spoke about open source visualization of scientific data, and assisted Kitware’s Bill Hoffman with a CMake introductory workshop.
  <br/>
  Desktop Summit 2011 included a variety of high quality talks. There was much focus on community building, big company involvement within the KDE and Gnome communities, and copyright assignment. Highlights included the talk “Exploring the Limits of Portability” by Till Adam and the panel “KDE Platform 4 Roadmap, which discussed how KDE libraries will be modularizing. Marcus and Bill also spent time fielding questions about CMake, the most well-known Kitware product among the attendees.
