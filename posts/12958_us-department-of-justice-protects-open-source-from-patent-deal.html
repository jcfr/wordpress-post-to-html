  WASHINGTON –
  <em>
   <br/>
   The Department of Justice announced today that in order to  proceed
   <br/>
   with the first phase of their acquisition of certain patents and  patent
   <br/>
   applications from Novell Inc., CPTN Holdings LLC and its owners
   <br/>
   have altered their original agreements to address the
   <br/>
   department’s
   <strong>
    antitrust
   </strong>
   concerns.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The department said that, as originally proposed,
  <br/>
  the deal would jeopardize the ability of
  <strong>
   open source software
  </strong>
  ,
  <br/>
  such as
  <strong>
   Linux
  </strong>
  , to
  <strong>
   continue to innovate
  </strong>
  and compete
  <br/>
  in the development and  distribution of server, desktop,
  <br/>
  and mobile operating systems,  middleware,
  <br/>
  and virtualization products.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the department will  allow the transaction to proceed,
  <br/>
  it will continue investigating the  distribution of the Novell patents
  <br/>
  to the CPTN owners.
