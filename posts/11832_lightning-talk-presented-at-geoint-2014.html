  At the 10th annual Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Symposium, Matt Turek, Kitware’s Assistant Director of Computer Vision, presented new technology being developed at Kitware that addresses the challenges of analyzing crowdsourced multimedia. The lightning talk “Large-Scale Understanding of Crowdsourced Multimedia Relationships” detailed approaches that would enable analysts to more efficiently evaluate large-scale multimedia collections, such as YouTube videos, for salient information. Kitware’s solutions center on automatic video grouping based on semantic concepts and interactive multimedia organization.
