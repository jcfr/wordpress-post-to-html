  This will become the final build of CMake 2.8.7 next Wednesday unless somebody finds and reports a showstopping (crasher, serious behavioral regression) issue between now and then.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the notable changes in this release are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   improved Eclipse support
  </li>
  <li>
   incremental improvements to the AUTOMOC feature added in the previous release
  </li>
  <li>
   more cryptographic hash implementations (SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512)
  </li>
  <li>
   file(…) and string(…) command additions for computing hash values
  </li>
  <li>
   added LINK_PUBLIC and LINK_PRIVATE options to target_link_libraries command
  </li>
  <li>
   and, as always, various minor bug fixes
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Similar to the previous release, we do not have pre-built binaries for the SunOS anymore. However, now we have two sets of installers for the Mac. The “Darwin” versions are for Mac OSX 10.4 and later, and are “ppc;i386” universal binaries. The “Darwin64” versions are for 10.6 and later, and are “x86_64;i386” universal binaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following is the list of changes in this rc since the previous one. Please try this version of CMake on your projects and report any issues to the list or the bug tracker.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Happy building!
