  The CMake 2.8.5 release candidate stream continues! You can find the
  <br/>
  source and binaries here: http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/?C=M;O=D
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope this will be the last release candidate for CMake 2.8.5. We’ll build
  <br/>
  and release 2.8.5 this week unless somebody reports a “must fix” major
  <br/>
  regression from a previous release.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pre-built binary builds for the IRIX platform are not yet built and
  <br/>
  uploaded. I’m having trouble connecting to the build machine for that
  <br/>
  platform at the moment. As soon as I can connect, I’ll get that built and
  <br/>
  uploaded. Until then, you can build CMake from source on that platform.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following is the list of changes in this release. Since we switched to
  <br/>
  git, this list is now the ‘git log’ one line summary written by the
  <br/>
  named CMake developers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please try this version of CMake on your projects and report any
  <br/>
  issues to the list or the bug tracker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Happy building!

  Bill Hoffman (4):
  <br/>
  Use devenv instead of msbuild for vs2010.
  <br/>
  Revert “With very long file names, VS 2010 was unable to compile files.”
  <br/>
  Use relative paths for custom command inputs.
  <br/>
  Look for VCExpress as a possible build tool as well as devenv.
