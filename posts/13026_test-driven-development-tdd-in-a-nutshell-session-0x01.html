  This sequence of posts intends to cover the basic concepts of
  <strong>
   TDD
  </strong>
  , by taking excerpts from the Book:
  <strong>
   “Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests”
  </strong>
  by  Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce (published by Addison Wesley)

  <strong>
   TDD in a Nutshell
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The cycle at the heart of TDD is:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Write a test
  </li>
  <li>
   Write some code to get the test to pass
  </li>
  <li>
   Refactor the code to be as simple an implementation of the tested featurs as possible
  </li>
  <li>
   Repeat
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As illustrated in the figure

 </p>
 <p>
  Tests provide feedback regarding
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Whether the system works
  </li>
  <li>
   If the system is well-structured
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  By writing the Test first, we get double the benefit. The Exercise of
  <strong>
   Writing the Tests
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Makes us clarify the acceptance criteria for the next piece of work – we have to ask ourselves how we can tell when we are done (design)
  </li>
  <li>
   Encourages us to write loosely coupled components, so they can easily be tested in isolation and, at higher levels, combined together (design)
  </li>
  <li>
   Adds an executable description of what the code does (design)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Whereas
  <strong>
   Running the Tests
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Detects errors while the context is fresh in our mind (implementation)
  </li>
  <li>
   Let us know when we’ve done enough, discouraging “gold plating” and unnecessary features (design)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This feedback cycle can be summed up by the
  <strong>
   Golden Rule
  </strong>
  of TDD:
  <em>
   “Never write new functionality without a failing test”
  </em>
