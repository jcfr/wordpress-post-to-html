  The release addresses several bugs and provides rendering enhancements, as well as improved integration, with MoleQueue and MongoChem using local socket communication. Over the coming weeks, we will begin merging several larger features including updates to the API, undo/redo support, support for multiple molecules, VTK visualization widgets, and improved assistance for client-server support. We will also review the application and make usability improvements.
