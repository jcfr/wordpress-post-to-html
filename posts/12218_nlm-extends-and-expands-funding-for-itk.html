  The growing success of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) and the key role played by Kitware as architectural leads has led the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to award an additional year of funding to Kitware. The main activities to be developed include software maintenance, documentation, training and user support.

  Project Background: In 1999 The National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in collaboration with partner institutes and agencies NIDCR, NEI, NSF, NIDCD, and NCI (see below for acronyms) awarded a three year, multi-million dollar contract to six groups to develop an open source segmentation and registration toolkit. The groups include GE Research, Kitware, UNC-CH, UPenn, U. of Tennesee (now University of Utah), and MathSoft (now Insightful). (Subcontractors include Harvard Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital, UPenn’s GRASP Lab, Columbia University, and the Univ. of Pittsburgh).
