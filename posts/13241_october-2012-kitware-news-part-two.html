   Kitware Presents at OSCON 2012
  </span>
  <br/>
  Kitware team members attended OSCON, the Open Source Convention, this summer, where they gave a presentation on OSEHRA, the Open Source Electronic Health Record Agent, and mobile 3D visualization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luis Ibáñez and Rick Avila, with Seong Ki Mun of OSHEHRA, presented “OSEHRA – Building an Open Source EHR for All” on July 19th as part of OSCON’s Healthcare track. The presentation covered the creation of OSEHRA in 2011, the background of the VistA EHR system, and how OSEHRA is working to create an open source ecosystem in which VistA can  to continue to thrive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pat Marion, one of the principal developers of VES, and Utkarsh Ayachit, one of the principal developers of ParaViewWeb,  presented “Mobile 3D Visualization.” They described the architecture, API, and usage of these systems, and provided real-time demonstrations, including client interface to a computing cluster. They also demonstrated the power of these tools through examples such as exploring a brain atlas on a phone, and interactive streamline generation and visualization on a tablet.
