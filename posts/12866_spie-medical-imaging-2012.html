  Kitware participated in several activities at the SPIE Medical Imaging (SPIE MI) meeting, which took place February 4-9 in San Diego, California. The SPIE MI meeting is one of the premier meetings for image processing, computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), PACS, ultrasonic Imaging, tomography, and biomedical Applications.

  user group meeting, which was held in conjunction with SPIE MI. This IGSTK event was a great opportunity for the core development team to hear directly from the user community.

 <p>
  Dr. Andinet Enquobahrie also presented at the “Image-Guided Procedures, Robotic Interventions, and Modeling” session. His talk focused on a non-linear FEM simulation pipeline that is being developed as part of a neurosurgery simulation project between Kitware Inc., Old Dominion University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

 <p>
  Dr. Stephen Aylward, Director of Medical Imaging at Kitware, chaired the vascular imaging session and participated in the annual “Dessert with Experts” event during which students shared ice cream with experts and discussed career paths and pitfalls. Additionally, Dr. Aylward was selected to be the assistant chair for the 2013 and 2014 SPIE MI: CAD conferences and the primary chair for the 2015 and 2016 SPIE MI: CAD conferences

  . The workshop featured interactive demonstrations that were complementary to the oral and poster presentations of the meeting.   Kitware showcased three of its new open-source applications:
  <strong>
   NIRVIEW
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Visomics
  </strong>
  , and

   Visomics
  </strong>
 </div>
 <p>
  This is a free, open-source, flexible, user-friendly visualization and analysis application for omics’ data; i.e  genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics.  It interfaces with existing web-based, biomedical databases, and it has demonstrated its utility on two applications: genetic predictors of preeclampsia and metabolomic correlates in cancer. Visomics development is supported by Kitware Inc., the Hamner Institute for Health Sciences, the University of Washington, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Visomics makes heavy use of VTK’s interface with the R statistical package.  For more information, visit
