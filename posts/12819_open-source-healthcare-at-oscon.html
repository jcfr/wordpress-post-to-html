   OSEHRA

  was created from an the
  <a href="http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2153">
   initiative of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
  </a>
  as a vehicle for building an Open Source ecosystem for supporting and bringing rapid innovation to the Electronic Health Record (EHR) space. Such an ecosystem would be used jointly by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The mission of OSEHRA is:
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   “to facilitate, through the use of the best practices in open source software development,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   the improvement and maintenance of EHR information systems.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   These systems will be freely available for all medical beneficiaries”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The VA has the most successful deployment of an Electronic Health Records system worldwide:

 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>
   “The VHA’s adoption of its VistA system is credited with playing a major role in enabling the Nation’s largest integrated health system to provide a highly regarded level of information technology supporting better care. For example, the use of electronic reminders and performance measurement to improve pneumonia vaccination rates probably saved the lives of 6,000 veterans with emphysema. VHA’s vaccination rate became the national benchmark as pneumonia hospitalizations were halved even while VHA’s patient population doubled—all while reducing taxpayer costs by $40 million. VistA also has enabled the VHA to reduce medication errors to a rate of 7 per million prescriptions written, well below the national average of 1 error in 20.”
