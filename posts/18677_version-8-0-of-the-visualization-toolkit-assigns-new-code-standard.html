  Kitware passed another turning point for the
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Visualization Toolkit
  </a>
  (VTK) with the release of version 8.0. The release became the first to benefit from C++11 compliant compilers. VTK now officially supports different aspects of C++11 such as default constructors, static assertion, non-static data members and enumeration declaration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The new features in C++11 allow developers to be more productive and eliminate common sources of bugs,” said

  , a principal engineer at Kitware and a developer of VTK. “Now that VTK enforces the availability of a C++11 compiler, developers can rely on capabilities without maintaining awkward workarounds.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For high-performance computing, the 8.0 release annexed the VTK-m framework of tools. These tools include new filters that process data. Kitware uploaded the filters to the Accelerators/Vtkm folder in the
  <a href="https://github.com/Kitware/VTK" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   VTK repository
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside of VTK-m, the release merged algorithms that process points and geometries. One algorithm (vtkLagrangianParticleTracker) visualizes particles as they move through simulations, and another algorithm (vtkCookieCutter) precisely cuts a two-dimensional (2D) geometric surface with a separate 2D surface that acts as a stencil. Additional algorithms (vtkDensifyPointCloudFilter and vtkUnsignedDistance) operate on point clouds. The release also augmented existing algorithms in VTK. The algorithm for

  </a>
  , for example, developed the ability to render volumes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, the release added the QVTKOpenGLWidget class, which provides a robust integration of VTK and Qt 5. The release also improved the OpenVR module, which pairs data with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The transitions to Qt 5, C++11 and Python 3 give users, developers and packagers a great deal of capability and flexibility in VTK-enabled applications,” DeMarle said.
