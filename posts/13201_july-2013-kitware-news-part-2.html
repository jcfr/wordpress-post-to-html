    Bender Moves the Visible Man
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  Bender, Kitware’s new open-source toolkit for repositioning voxelized anatomical models, was introduced in late April. Bender is used to reposition 3D labelmap models for use in computing voxel-level Specific Absorption Rates (SAR), the rates at which energy is absorbed by the body when it is exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and ultrasound.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most anatomical models are derived from MRI or CT images which are acquired with the subject laying on a narrow platform. With these imaging modalities it is not possible to acquire images where the subject is sitting or extending their arms. Bender solves this problem by allowing the pose of the subject’s anatomy in the acquired image to be changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bender provides algorithms and a user-friendly application for rigging, skinning, posing, and volume resampling, enabling researchers to interactively reposition an anatomic labelmap into a desired pose. Upcoming developments to Bender will improve the anatomical repositioning by modeling tissue-specific deformation characteristics more precisely. This work is supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory under Contract No. D22009D10.

    ITK Workshop Tour 2013
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  ITK team members Matt McCormick, Luis Ibáñez, and Xiaoxiao Liu took part in a traveling trilogy of events and hackathons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <span style="font-size: x-small;">
    MNI at McGill University
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Their first stop was at the Montreal Neurology Institute (MNI) at McGill University, where they were hosted by Dr. Louis Collins and his lab at MNI.  The group at MNI consisted of 70 participants, and waiting list of 30 others due to limited seating! Attendees were given VirtualBox machines with ITK and tutorial materials pre-installed. They were then led through a hands-on image analysis examples using SimpleITK with IPython notebooks, and step-by-step basic image filtering and ITKv4 image registration C++ examples.  Dr. Vladimir S. Fonov from the MNI lab also presented an example of IO with the MINC2 file format inside ITK.  Support for the MINC2 file format was added in ITK 4.4.0 after a previous hackathon in Montreal and an epic number of patch revisions in Gerrit.

  <br/>
  <span style="font-size: x-small;">
   <strong>
    UNC Chapel Hill
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  The second stop on the tour was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where they were hosted by Cory Quammen from the Computer Science department. More than 50 attendees took part in the workshop, most of them from UNC’s Biomedical Research Imaging Center, the Biostatistics department, and the Neuro Image Analysis and Research Lab; along with a small group from the Biomedical Engineering Department at Duke University.
 </p>
 <p>
  As with the MNI event, the group was led through hands-on exercises and examples. After the workshop, the team was shown some cool new visualization demos, and got to experience the infamous virtual reality pit.
 </p>
 <p>
  A productive hackathon took place the next day, during which Cory fixed bugs in the SCIFIO module used to read microscopy images.  Matt worked on preparations for the release of ITK 4.4.0.  Luis help Pei Zhang submit his first patch, which allowed Pew-Tian Yap to follow soon after.  Xiaoxiao helped Jian Cheng organize his code into an ITKv4 module.

  <br/>
  <strong>
   Iowa University
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Lastly the team traveled to Iowa University, where they were hosted by Dr. Hans Johnson. The forty-person crowd consisted of researchers and graduate students from the Biomedical Engineering, Psychiatry, Radiology, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering departments. Many attendees were ITK beginners without C++ experience, so the workshop focused on learning to use SimpleITK. Luis came up with a gamification strategy by writing five challenging questions for each of exercise and put them up in a simple scoring form on Google Doc to let people compete. This was a great success. Most people were able to progress well to the very end at their own pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next day, the team met with Hans, his colleagues, and his students and had a productive time closing open issues, including a triage of JIRA issues. As you can see from the charts below, many issues were closed on that day (the 31th).  We found many issues that had been completed, but not closed, were no longer relevant, or had no actions that could be taken on them in their current state. Many issues were closed by requesting the the original submitter to provide more details and encouraging them to provide at least partial solutions to the problems they identified.

    Kitware Hosts 2nd Annual Blood Drive
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  On June 28th, Kitware headquarters, located in Clifton Park, NY, hosted their 2nd annual Red Cross Blood Drive. The day started at 10 am, with eager employees and  several community members ready and waiting to donate.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were lucky enough to be hosting the drive on a sunny day, which resulted in a steady and consistent turnout. Overall the Kitware drive collected 18 pints of whole blood and six pints of double-red blood. Keep an eye out on our events calendar next Summer to take part in our 3rd annual drive!
