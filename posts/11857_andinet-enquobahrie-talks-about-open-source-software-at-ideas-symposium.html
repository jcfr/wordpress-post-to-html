  Dr. Andinet Enquobahrie, Assistant Director of Kitware’s Medical  Computing Team, presented a talk on the role of open source-software in  surgical simulation at the Innovation, Design, and Emerging Alliances in  Surgery (IDEAS): Virtual Surgery Symposium. The symposium took place at  the Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston, MA, on November 23, 2013.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goals of the symposium were to provide a comprehensive update  regarding state-of-the-art technology in virtual surgery and to bring  together surgeons, engineers, and educators to collaboratively discuss  challenges and opportunities in the field.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Enquobahrie presented during the first session titled Disruptive  Technologies in Virtual Surgery. During his presentation, Dr.  Enquobahrie provided an overview of open-source tools and detailed  current virtual surgery projects at Kitware. He also discussed how  technological advancements in medical imaging, image registration  algorithms, visualization technologies, and haptics systems are helping  to increase the adoption of virtual surgery systems. As Dr. Enquobahrie  noted, software is utilized for a variety of purposes in virtual  surgery, including anatomical modeling, physics-based animation,  collision detection and response, 3D rendering, and scene graph  generation.
