  Recently the VTK community has established an on-line
  <a href="http://www.midasjournal.org/?journal=35" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   VTK Journal
  </a>
  . Like its sister, the
  <a href="http://www.midasjournal.org/?journal=3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Insight Journal
  </a>
  , the VTK Journal supports open access publication, open data and open source to foster the growth of Open Science. We encourage you to visit and contribute articles and/or reviews to the VTK Journal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently there are two articles in the Journal, with two more pending final publication. Once these two articles go live later today, the VTK users and developers lists will receive an automated email notifying the community of their availability. This is your cue to review and/or try out the submissions. This process will continue for future article submissions.
