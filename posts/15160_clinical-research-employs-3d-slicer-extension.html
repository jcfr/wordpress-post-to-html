  extension of
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/platforms/#3d-slicer">
   3D Slicer
  </a>
  (Fedorov et al., 2012a) to support an in-bore transperineal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided biopsy procedure. The clinical research procedure was performed under institutional review board (IRB) approval in the

  The
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  extension
  <a href="https://github.com/SlicerProstate/SliceTracker/graphs/contributors">
   has been in the works
  </a>
  for more than a year now to replace the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   <a href="https://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Modules:ProstateNav-Documentation-3.6">
    ProstateNav
   </a>
  </span>
  module of 3D Slicer version 3. The original
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   ProstateNav
  </span>
  module was released over five years ago. It has been used, with relatively minor changes, to support more than 400 cases in a research study that started in late 2009. The setup and results of this study have been described in several publications (Fedorov et al., 2012b; Tokuda et al., 2012; Penzkofer et al., 2015; and Behringer et al., 2015). Since ProstateNav relies on the now obsolete and non-maintained 3D Slicer version 3, it has been a long-standing task to develop the next generation of the functionality in the current version 4 of the 3D Slicer software. These improvements became critical as the use of the module increased in the operating room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Andrey Fedorov supervised the development of
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  . Peter Behringer completed initial prototyping as part of his Master’s thesis project at the University of Luebeck. Peter was a visiting scholar at the
  <a href="http://www.spl.harvard.edu/">
   Surgical Planning Lab (SPL)
  </a>
  for about five months . Christian Herz joined the team in the Summer of 2015, as a visiting engineer from Fraunhofer MEVIS. He became the lead developer of
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  . Christian reimplemented the initial prototype, adding features and conducting tests with earlier versions of
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  in “shadow” mode (running in parallel with
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   ProstateNav
  </span>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  After several months of testing in shadow mode, fixing bugs, conducting prospective user interviews, and identifying and correcting issues,
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  was officially added as an extension to the 3D Slicer
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   ExtensionManager
  </span>
  . This addition occurred on Wednesday, July 13, 2016. On the following day, the nightly version of Slicer and the packaged
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  extension were used on a Mac computer to support AMIGO prostate biopsy case number 419, for the first time without running it as a shadow of
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   ProstateNav
  </span>
  . As Andrey Fedorov
  <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/pull/1338#issuecomment-232952801">
   noted
  </a>
  on GitHub, “What was really amazing was that the extension built without errors on the mac dashboard right away, and the next day we were able to use the packaged version of the extension during a biopsy procedure in AMIGO! I could not believe that this was happening!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on early experience and evaluation to date,
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  promises to reduce the interaction time for the operator, improve usability of the interface, and introduce much needed features, such as hanging protocols for individual steps of the workflow, simplified segmentation, and continuous, mostly automatic, tracking of prostate motion during the procedure.
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  is based on the officially maintained version of 3D Slicer and latest the releases of the
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/platforms/#vtk">
   Visualization Toolkit
  </a>
  (VTK), the
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/platforms/#itk">
   Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
  </a>
  (ITK)/SimpleITK, and the
  <a href="http://dcmtk.org">
   Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Toolkit
  </a>
  (DCMTK). The module is easily available to the 3D Slicer community as a free open-source extension.
 </p>
 <p>
  In our view,
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  is an excellent example of a true collaboration between open-source developers and clinical researchers that is serving clinical research today. The registration technology underlying
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  originated in ITK and the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   BRAINSFit
  </span>
  registration module developed by Hans Johnson and colleagues at the University of Iowa. Andras Lasso from Perklab at Queen’s University contributed the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   VolumeClip
  </span>
  module that provides the automated segmentation functionality. Calibration routines were migrated from
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   ProstateNav
  </span>
  , and were originally developed by Simon DiMaio, perhaps a decade ago. Steve Piper is the lead developer of the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   Editor
  </span>
  module, which is also integrated into the workflow. Junichi Tokuda provided the advanced calibration routines that were developed more recently. Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin at Kitware, along with many other members of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) community, contributed key 3D Slicer infrastructure features, such as support for multiple extension dependencies.
 </p>
 <p>
  The team could not have achieved this milestone without the daily enthusiastic support of the clinical staff at AMIGO. Kemal Tuncali is the lead interventional radiologist for MR-guided biopsy (and cryotherapy) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital as well as in AMIGO. He is a champion of image-guided therapy research that enables better patient care. His thoughtful suggestions, patience, and humor motivate and support the team. Soichiro Tani, a visiting scholar from Shiga University of Medical Science, has been a relentless supporter of the program and the operator of
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   ProstateNav
  </span>
  . He has provided feedback and encouragement for the improved software. Janice Fairhurst, the MR technologist at AMIGO, provided feedback in the early stages of development. The development team looks forward to our continued work with the AMIGO clinical team, and the 3D Slicer community to further refine and deploy
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   SliceTracker
  </span>
  in clinical research studies.
