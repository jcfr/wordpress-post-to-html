  On behalf of the Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK) team, Kitware has released IGSTK version 5.2. IGSTK is a component-based framework that provides a common functionality for image-guided surgery applications.

  Major features of this release include an updated version of ITK (v4.2); significant improvements to the reslicing component, which will now require VTK v5.10 or higher; and a new git repository for IGSTK applications. Currently, this repository contains the programs used for an educational tutorial focused on the basic principles of image guided intervention (IGI). This release also contains numerous miscellaneous bug fixes, which are detailed on the IGSTK wiki.
