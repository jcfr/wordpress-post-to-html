  Kitware has announced that VolView, a commercial product  for exploring and analyzing complex 3D medical or scientific data, will  now be available free of charge to researchers around the world.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  First developed in 1999 as an intuitive, interactive system for  volume visualization, VolView allows users to load and interactively  explore datasets using both 2D and 3D display methods. To view a short  demonstration,

 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Compatible with Windows, Mac or Linux, VolView is capable of volume  rendering, maximum intensity projections and oblique reformatting. In  addition, VolView can load multiple datasets simultaneously, support  creating and applying 2D and 3D display presets and even make image  measurements within a user defined contour. This simple and easy-to-use  interface allows for a more rapid navigation for the user.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  “The 3D imaging and segmentation capabilities of VolView are among  the most advanced in the world” said Rick Avila, Senior Director of  Health Care Solutions at Kitware. “Our goal is to provide this advanced  imaging tool to researchers around the world and work with the imaging  community to improve the capabilities and help us make a future version  of VolView system both free and open source.”
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Although not approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), hence  restricted from use in clinical settings, VolView has immense research  value and limitless real-world medical potential.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  For instance, a 3D rendering of the size and shape of an ailing  patient’s aorta would allow medical researchers to evaluate whether  certain display methods are better than others for identifying subtle  aneurisms. Additionally, studying the performance of volumetric lesion  sizing with Kitware’s open source lesion sizing toolkit algorithm will  help researchers determine better methods for assessing response to  therapy.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  VolView has been commercially available for over a decade, and is  developed using Kitware’s Visualization Toolkit (VTK), and the Insight  Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  VTK is an open-source software system for 3D computer graphics, image  processing and visualization that has led to numerous pioneering  applications. ITK was developed over a decade ago with the National  Institutes of Health as a dynamic, self-sustaining, cross-platform and  open-source application that provides the tools for in-depth image  analysis.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Kitware offers consulting services and has produced numerous  customized versions of VolView in diverse areas including telemedicine,  dental planning, and pharmaceutical research.  Kitware also works  collaboratively on research endeavors, and is actively seeking funding  to move VolView from a free tool available in binary format to a true  open-source platform.
