  Close on the heels of another fun VTK hackathon, we had our first ParaView hackathon on Wednesday, July 13.

  Forgive my tardiness in remembering to take the picture. I am one of those who subscribes to the “photo plate of my eye” philosophy. By the time it occurred to me to take the picture, we had lost a few heads!
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, it was a good turnout, with folks attending from Clifton Park, North Carolina, Santa Fe and Albuquerque!
 </p>
 <p>
  As of today, we have over 100 bugs closed — a large part by Alan Scott from Sandia alone, who painstakingly closed bugs that are obsolete or already fixed and no longer reproducible!
 </p>
 <p>
  With over 15 merge requests closed, several of which were opened during the hackathon to address various issues and a few more still awaiting reviews, we can definitely call it a useful exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Same as VTK, we plan on holding these hackathons regularly going forward.
