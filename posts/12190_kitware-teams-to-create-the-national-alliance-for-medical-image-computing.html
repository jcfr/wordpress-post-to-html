  Kitware Inc., a high-tech software company specializing in imaging, 3D graphics, and visualization, is part of a team awarded one of four grants by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) dedicated to advancing biomedical research. In a highly-competitive review process, the NIH awarded four prestigious National Centers of Biomedical Computing (NCBCs) to “develop and implement the core of a universal computing infrastructure that is urgently needed to speed progress in biomedical research. The centers will create innovative software programs and other tools that enable the biomedical community to integrate, analyze, model, simulate, and share data on human health and disease.” Members of the winning team include Brigham and Womens Hospital, MIT, Harvard, Mass General Hospital, Kitware, GE Research, Georgia Tech, Dartmouth, UC San Diego, UCLA, the University of Utah, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and Isomics, Inc. The grant awards for the four NCBCs total $79.7 million dollars over a five year period.
