  The Pharmaceutical industry faces a difficult challenge:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It takes
   <strong>
    10
   </strong>
   to
   <strong>
    15 years
   </strong>
   to develop a new drug
  </li>
  <li>
   It cost between
   <strong>
    $800M
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    $1,000M
   </strong>
   to do so
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Very few compounds make it through the research pipeline
  <br/>
  to become products that can have a clinical impact.
 </p>

 The time has come for bold ideas and
 <strong>
  disruptive technologies
 </strong>
