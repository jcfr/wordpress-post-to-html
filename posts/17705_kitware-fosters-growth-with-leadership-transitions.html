  Less than three weeks after it celebrated its 19th anniversary, Kitware made transitions in team management and organizational structure to foster growth and to strengthen its position as a leader in open-source technical computing. The transitions took place at the company shareholders meeting on March 23, 2017.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the meeting, Kitware named former Vice President of Commercial Operations Lisa Avila, Ph.D., as president and CEO. Avila co-founded Kitware in 1998. Throughout the last two decades, Avila has influenced every aspect of the business from technical development and project management to business development and communications.

  “I am proud that our innovative open-source software has advanced scientific research, improved healthcare outcomes and enhanced our national security,” Avila said. “I look forward to maintaining our commitment to our customers, collaborators, communities and team members while fostering continued growth by expanding into new domains.”
