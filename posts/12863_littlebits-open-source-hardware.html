  Ayah makes a solid case on why the principles and tools of technology must be available to anyone:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   because this world that we are living in, this interactive world is ours.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the kind of DIY initiatives that will be at the root of the renaissance of science of technology, by demystifying tools and principles to make them available to anyone. It is an important reminder that creativity and innovation arise anywhere and must not be the exclusive domain of advanced research institutions. Ayah provides a great example, by bringing her activities at the MIT Media Lab to become a source of enjoyable education to everyone.
