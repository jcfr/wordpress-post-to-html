The goal of a challenge is to accelerate the pace of research on a demanding academic and clinical problem by fostering collaboration, communication, and understanding via the quantitative comparison of competing methods using standardized data sets.

   When submitting a challenge proposal, the organizing team, the challenge and workshop schedules, and the challenge topic and representative data are critical.  Each challenge needs an organizing team responsible for providing training and test data, defining the tasks, specifying the metrics used to measure performance, managing entries, and organizing the on-site workshop presentations. Challenges will have half-day workshops at the conference.  We encourage on-site evaluations and scientific presentations during these workshops, but the operation of a challenge and the agenda for each workshop is determined by the challenge organizers.

   e encourage new challenge topics as well as topics that were addressed during previous challenges.  New challenge topics could introduce new imaging devices, new biomedical applications, or existing applications that would benefit from focused attention from the medical imaging research community.  Challenges that address previous challenge topics could feature, for example, repeating a challenge to track how the field has advanced, addressing bottlenecks in existing processing pipelines, processing larger datasets, analyzing specific sub-populations, or exploring the utility of particular technologies such as deep learning.

   We also welcome proposals to contribute challenge data.  Such proposals will be vetted with challenge organizers to increase data diversity, provide new insights, or increase statistical significance of challenge results.  As with challenge topic proposals, challenge data proposals can address new or existing challenge topics.
