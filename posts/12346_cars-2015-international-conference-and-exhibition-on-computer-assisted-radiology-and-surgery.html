  Dženan Zukić will present this paper focsed on SlicerPET: a user-friendly workflow based module developed using open source software libraries and the 3D Slicer platform to guide needle biopsy in the interventional suite. Biopsy is commonly used to confirm cancer diagnosis when radiologically indicated. Given the ability of PET to localize malignancies in heterogeneous tumors and tumors that do not have a CT correlate, PET/CT guided biopsy may improve the diagnostic yield of biopsies. To facilitate PET/CT guided needle biopsy, we developed a workflow that allows us to bring PET image guidance into the interventional CT suite.  The figure below shows two steps in the workflow: Path planning on fused PET-CT image (Top) and Needle-guidance step (bottom).

  This is a collaborative work with Children National Medical Center. Dzenan will present methods developed to enable the precise, quantitative comparison of cranial shape before and after cranial vault reconstruction to determine the efficacy of specific reconstructive techniques. Craniosynostosis is caused by premature fusion of cranial sutures resulting in cranial malformation. Surgical treatment planning of craniosynostosis is mostly qualitative, subjective and irreproducible guided mainly by the surgeon’s experience. This work focuses on development of a virtual surgical planning system to enable quantitative evaluation and precise surgery. Objective postoperative evaluation of cranial shape could provide important information on the success of the surgical procedure. Point-wise distance were computed between the identified closest normal shape (CN),  normal mean shape (MN),  pre-operative (Pre) and actual post-operative CT scan (Post). After surgery, mean deformations over the cranium were improved by 24.12% in relation to the closest normal shape and 39.87% in relation to the mean normal shape. These improvements were particularly striking on the left parietal bone, 79.01% vs. 74.33% in relation to the closest and mean normal shapes, respectively. These results are in agreement with the clinical observation that the left parietal is one of the most affected by left coronal synostosis. The figure below shows representative visualizations (camera position is above, in front and to the left of the head). Top left: Pre-MS. Bottom left: Post-MS. Top center: Pre-CN. Bottom center: Post-CN. Bottom right: Post-Pre. A-P, L-R and S-I: anatomical orientation. Distance is in millimeters.

  In current practice, the decision of performing surgical correction for patients with craniosynostosis is
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   typically based on subjective visual assessment of the severity of the cranial malformation. These decisions
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   have a major impact on the management of these young patients requiring surgical intervention to
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   correct malformation in the cranial bones and reduce intracranial pressure. The bone correction procedure
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   can be simulated via biomechanical modeling based on the physical properties of the bone. The resulting
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   desirable post-correction shape and the stress of the bone can then be used to evaluate and compare
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   individual bone correction plans before carrying out the actual surgeries, as well to quantitatively analyze
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   the efficacy of specific reconstruction techniques. Depending on the bone rigidity, which is highly correlated
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   to children’s age, the cranial bone might fracture due to the increased amount of pressure during the
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   surgery. Therefore, stress measurements are important to evaluate surgical plans and avoid undesirable
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   bone fracture incidents. Currently there are no available surgical planning systems to optimize intervention
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   and assist in the reconstruction of the cranial vault. Our aim is to provide objective biomechanical modeling tools to facilitate evaluating and optimizing surgical plans for craniosynostosis correction. Figure below shows a t

   wo dimensional profiles of the preoperative shape and the optimal shape surface. In the
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   zoomed-in-in region, a displacement vector (yellow) is obtained by averaging a sub-sampled set of displacement
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   vectors (black). This vector is then used to obtain constraint points on the optimal model surface. The
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   two points (in green) are used to create a boundary condition on the surface of the preoperative shape.
