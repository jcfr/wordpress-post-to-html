 <p>
  Changes to the itk::Image class that make it behave now like the itk::OrientedImage. This modification has profound implications for anyone working on image registration and image resampling. It is strongly recommended to carefully review the results of your image registration programs once you adopt this release.

   ITK 3.10.1 Patch Released
  </strong>
  <br/>
  A patch to the ITK 3.10 was released on December 8, 2008.
 </p>
 <p>
  The major changes in this patch were releated to fixing many filters to take the image orientation into account; many thanks to Hans Johnson (University of Iowa) and Tom Vercauteren (Mauna Kea Technologies) for their hard work on identifying and fixing these problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Users are strongly encouraged to adopt the ITK 3.10.1 patch release in place of ITK 3.10.
