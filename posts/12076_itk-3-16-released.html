   contributed on an Insight Journal article by G. Lehmann. These added classes were the remaining components of a 70+ class label map morphology module.

   This release offers a fix to a long standing issue in ITK regarding the computation of physical coordinates associated with pixels. This fix is enabled by default, but if you need to revert it to the previous behavior for backward compatibility reasons, you can disable it by turning off the CMake flag:
   <br/>
   ITK_USE_CENTERED_PIXEL_COORDINATES_CONSISTENTLY. Thanks to Tom Vercauteren and Michel Audette for their hard work on getting this difficult issue fixed.

   Many improvements and fixes in the I/O infrastructure were contributed by Brad Lowekamp, making it now possible to manage large image files through the streaming infrastructure of the data pipeline. In particular Brad contributed examples illustrating how to process the entire Visible Human dataset via an ITK pipeline.
