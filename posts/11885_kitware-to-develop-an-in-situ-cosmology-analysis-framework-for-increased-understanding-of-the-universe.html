  Kitware today announces the award of new Phase II SBIR funding from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for the continued development of an innovative framework for performing
  <em>
   in situ
  </em>
  analysis of large-scale cosmological simulations.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Through a collaborative effort between Kitware and scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Phase I of this project focused on the development of a lightweight
  <em>
   in situ
  </em>
  analysis framework and the successful coupling of this framework with the Hybrid/Hardware Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC), one of the core N-Body codes at the DOE.

  demonstrated the feasibility of the approach, and highlighted the need for a data management component to enable direct comparisons of simulations and observations.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Phase II, the team will continue development of the
  <em>
   in situ
  </em>
  analysis library and
  <em>
   in situ
  </em>
  algorithms for identifying, extracting, and tracking features in large-scale cosmological simulations. Further, the library will be integrated with data management functionality and web-based technologies, which will be developed to simplify data mining and visualization workflows.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In addition to the direct benefits to the field of cosmology, it is anticipated that the infrastructure developed during this Phase II effort will provide wide-reaching benefits to many industries as it will enable the analysis of massive scientific datasets; empower scientists to glean insights that were not possible before by embedding analysis within the simulation; allow for direct comparisons of simulations and experiments; and simplify data management and scientific workflows.

  “We are incredibly pleased that the DOE continues to support our cosmology framework and sees its broad applicability across the sciences,” said Dr. Berk Geveci, Director of Scientific Computing at Kitware. “We are excited to continue our development and to be providing critical workflows that will lead to future innovation and understanding in the field of cosmology.”
