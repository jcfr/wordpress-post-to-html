  . This conference is the latest in a long series, where novel developments in the acquisition, formation, analysis and display of medical images are presented, discussed, dissected, and extended. Over the last three decades, IPMI has evolved with the medical imaging community it serves.  Today, IPMI is widely recognized as a preeminent international forum for presentation of leading-edge research in the medical imaging field including the following topics:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Image Analysis and Signal Processing
  </li>
  <li>
   Shape Representation and Analysis
  </li>
  <li>
   Image Registration and Fusion
  </li>
  <li>
   Functional and Molecular Imaging
  </li>
  <li>
   Image Acquisition Methods and Devices
  </li>
  <li>
   Computational Physiology
  </li>
  <li>
   Machine Learning
  </li>
  <li>
   Data Visualization
  </li>
  <li>
   Statistical and Mathematical Models
