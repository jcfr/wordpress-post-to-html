   Science and Technology Policy Office
  </a>
  has a threefold mission:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   To provide the
   <strong>
    President
   </strong>
   and his senior staff with accurate, relevant,
   <br/>
   and timely scientific and technical advice on all matters of consequence;
  </li>
  <li>
   To ensure that the policies of the Executive Branch are informed by sound science
  </li>
  <li>
   To ensure that the scientific and technical work of the Executive Branch is
   <br/>
   properly coordinated so as to
   <strong>
    provide the greatest benefit to society
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

  <strong>
   freely available to the public
