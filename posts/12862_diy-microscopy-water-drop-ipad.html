  It has been said that some of his initial observations were made using a drop of water as a magnifying lens…
 </p>
 <p>
  This sounds like a far-fetched story until one thinks about the ease with which a small drop of water can be produced, compared to the difficulty of making a glass lens of the same size. The magnifying power of a lens is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of its surface. Therefore, the smaller the radius of the water drop, the higher its optical magnification will be. Careful observation after a rainy day will persuade us that the water drop can actually be used as a powerful single-lens microscope.

  There is of course, the practical challenge of holding that small drop of water very close in front of your eye, and putting the sample to be observed on the other side. Luckily for us today, by mixing very old and very new technology, we can get the best of both worlds and verify some of Leeuwenhoek’s observations.

   Here is what you need:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A cup of water
  </li>
  <li>
   A cotton swab
  </li>
  <li>
   An iPad (or any other tablet-like device with a front-facing camera)
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  The iPad 2 has a front camera that is protected by the same cover glass that extends through the rest of the front surface. This is great for us, because we can simply:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Place the iPad on a flat surface
  </li>
  <li>
   Immerse the cotton swab in the cup of water
  </li>
  <li>
   Squeeze the cotton swab head on top of the iPad camera until a drop of water falls on top of the camera
   <br/>
   This may require several tries, since you want to get:
  </li>
 </ul>
