  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   The big difference in ParaView Catalyst for ParaView 5.5 will be how Catalyst Python scripts are generated in the graphical user interface (GUI). With all of the functionality that’s gone into Catalyst, the script generator plugin in the GUI organically grew to the point that we needed to do a full rework to simplify the interface. While the changes in ParaView 5.5 are not radical, they are the first steps toward a much better setup. This setup should be completed in the next release of ParaView.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   The most significant change is the move of the functionality of the Catalyst script generator plugin to the Catalyst GUI menu. With this change, the plugin won’t have to be loaded in order to generate Catalyst scripts. If you build ParaView with Python support, the GUI will automatically include the menu item to add in data extract writers to the Catalyst pipeline and the menu item to generate the Catalyst Python script. Both of these menu items will be available under the Catalyst menu instead of under the CoProcessing and Writers menus, which are added to the GUI when the Catalyst Script Generator plugin is loaded. Note that the menu items will still only be available when ParaView is built with Python wrapping enabled.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Another change will enable all the filters that you can use. Previously, if ParaView used the built-in server or a separate
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier">
    pvserver
   </span>
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   that runs with a single process, only the “serial” filters were made available in the Filters menu. These filters exclude
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;font-family: 'courier new', courier">
   Process Id Scalars
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   and

   aren’t normally useful in serial, they will now be available in the Filters menu, in case you want to save a state file, generate a Python script or create a Catalyst Python script that will be used later in a parallel operation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   The next change will affect the naming of Catalyst simulation inputs. Simulation inputs allow the adaptor to build only what Catalyst needs to perform proper in situ processing. An example use case is a Particle-In-Cell simulation, where there are two logical data types: a grid-based data type that is used for continuous, distribution type fields (e.g., an electric field) and a particle-based data type that is used for discrete type fields (e.g., the momentum for each particle). By implementing Catalyst channels, the adaptor will be able to fully provide both the cell-based information and the particle-based information. As a result, when outputting iso-surfaces of the cell-based information, the particle-based information will never need to be constructed. This will save both computation and memory.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   An additional change relates to the adaptor. Currently, when the adaptor provides more than a single channel, the Catalyst pipeline needs to identify the appropriate channel, according to the channel input name. As a result, when you construct a Catalyst pipeline through the GUI, you have to specify what inputs were needed by this same channel name. In ParaView 5.5, Catalyst will automatically add the channel name as field information when it gets a dataset from the adaptor. When Catalyst produces a data extract, the GUI will know from which channel that data extract originated. Keep in mind that a pipeline can request datasets for all channels in a combined analysis and visualization. With the change, multiple datasets will be read into the GUI and processed together.

   Catalyst Examples
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   We are continuing to add to and improve the Catalyst examples, which are available in the Examples/Catalyst subdirectory of the source code. These examples have been invaluable for getting started and instrumenting code with Catalyst. They also help to demonstrate Catalyst functionality under different conditions. The following Catalyst examples will be added in ParaView 5.5:

  </b>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   <br/>
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   This example shows how ghost cells need to be marked in the adaptor for simulations that use ghost cell information. The number of ghost cell levels generated in the adaptor can be controlled with the

  <span style="font-weight: 400;font-family: 'courier new', courier">
   -l
  </span>

  <span style="font-weight: 400;font-family: 'courier new', courier">
   vtkUnstructuredGrid
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">

   <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier">
    -i

  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;font-family: 'courier new', courier">
   vtkImageData
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   ). This example is also useful for simplified parallel testing of Catalyst output, when the adaptor produces ghost cells.

 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   CxxMultiChannelInputExample
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   This example shows how multiple channels, or inputs, can be provided by the adaptor. The example is meant to mimic a Particle-In-Cell simulation where there is an underlying Cartesian grid

   Catalyst Edition Improvements

 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   While you may use a full ParaView build, especially for development work, the Catalyst editions provide you with a slimmed-down library that can be significantly easier to build. Catalyst editions improvements in ParaView 5.5 do the following:
