  On behalf of the Kitware team and broader, global CMake community, we are happy to announce the release of CMake 2.8.10. This release features support for the latest versions of Visual Studio and Xcode, target properties improvements, and updates to generator expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the 2.8.10 release, users now have a new way to arrange exported targets that depend on other targets into “export sets.” In addition, there are new target properties for PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and PDB_NAME implemented for Visual Studio 7 and later.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generator expressions, which are used to introduce conditional statements at generate time rather than at CMake compile time, are now available in more contexts, notably in the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target properties. There are also new generator expressions available in the 2.8.10 release.
 </p>
 <p>
  The file(DOWNLOAD command can accommodate https URLs. The pre-built binaries for this are available from Kitware and link to OpenSSL. The team has also added uniform compiler “id” and version number variables available for nearly all known compilers and platforms.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the above changes, there were many other improvements that can be seen in the
