  I recently finished one of the best books
  <br/>
  that I have read this year:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Business-Learned-Grateful-ebook/dp/B004QZ9P6A">
   “Everything I know about BUSINESS I learned from the GRATEFUL DEAD”

 </p>
 <p>
  In this book, Barry Barnes describes the lessons
  <br/>
  that the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead">
   Grateful Dead
  </a>
  can teach to businesses.

 </p>
 <p>
  Barnes talks about the highlights of the business wisdom of the Grateful Dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The business wisdom emerged from the understanding that the band and
  <br/>
  their fans were part of a single community, as opposed to being linked by a
  <br/>
  producer-consumer relationship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly, a counter-culture rock band might be an unusual place to look for
  <br/>
  advice on how to run a business, particularly considering the way the band
  <br/>
  lived through the 60’s and how their experimentation with drugs may have
  <br/>
  disrupted their lives. However, Barnes is clear in stating that a lot of the
  <br/>
  wisdom from the band was not the result of foresight, but rather something
  <br/>
  to be appreciated in retrospective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are some remarkable points made in the book, that hopefully will motivate
  <br/>
  you to put this fascinating book on your reading list.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Strategic Improvisation
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Business plans are good initial versions, but are only valuable until the first
  <br/>
  unexpected event happens. From that point on, your business is better enabled
  <br/>
  to survive if you can display the flexible behavior of strategic improvisation:
  <strong>
   Plan
  </strong>
  ,
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Act
  </strong>
  and make adjustments in
  <strong>
   Real Time
  </strong>
  . In other words, apply the same principles
  <br/>
  of Agile programming to businesses practices.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do this right, it is important to continuously
  <strong>
   <em>
    disrupt old habits
   </em>
  </strong>
  , question common
  <br/>
  practices, and be suspect of the “
  <em>
   tyranny of common sense
  </em>
  “. It is also important to
  <br/>
  <strong>
   <em>
    embrace errors
   </em>
  </strong>
  , since in an environment of continuous adaptation to circumstances
  <br/>
  the entire system will never be perfectly fit to the environmental conditions. However,
  <br/>
  the flexibility of being able to adapt to the changing conditions is what empowers
  <br/>
  your business to survive in a dynamic environment. To achieve flexibility, it is important
  <br/>
  to
  <strong>
   <em>
    minimize the internal structure
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which is what introduces rigidity and inertia in an
  <br/>
  organization, and prevent it from adapting fast enough to external changing conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Live your Values
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Embracing strong corporate values rooted in the understanding of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    social mission
   </em>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  of the organization, as opposed to confusing profits with organizational purpose, is
  <br/>
  one of the features that paradoxically leads to truly profitable businesses. In particular,
  <br/>
  dedication and commitment to the social mission of a business organization ensure that
  <br/>
  its customer base will embrace the organization as a preferred provider of goods and
  <br/>
  services, creating a symbiotic relationship with the organization. When your customers
  <br/>
  turn into fans, they bring more customers, they do your marketing, and they show you
  <br/>
  the way to solid growth. Barnes eloquently describes this as
  <strong>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest">
    “Enlightened Self-Interest”
   </a>
  </strong>
  .
  <br/>
  The realization that the long term survival of an organization relies on creating a positive
  <br/>
  relationship with those who pay for the goods and services. Also summarized as:
  <br/>
  <em>
   “An organization will do well, by doing good”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Be Kind to Your Customers
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  By offering quality products and services, and ensuring that customer interactions
  <br/>
  result in win-win situations, an organization will further solidify the symbiotic relationship
  <br/>
  with their customer base, and build upon a culture of loyalty to their brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Share your Content
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is probably the lesson that most businesses missed to understand with the
  <br/>
  advent of the Information Age. In contrast, the Grateful Dead understood that it
  <br/>
  is
  <strong>
   familiarity
  </strong>
  , not
  <strong>
   scarcity
  </strong>
  , that creates economic value. As Cory Doctorow
  <br/>
  put it:
  <em>
   “The problem for authors is not Piracy, but Obscurity”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  By generously sharing content, and allowing their fans to record their concerts and
  <br/>
  trade the tapes of the recordings, the Grateful Dead
  <strong>
   grew the pie
  </strong>
  of their fans,
  <br/>
  and cultivated in them a feeling of
  <strong>
   belonging
  </strong>
  to a community. They understood that
  <br/>
  what they were selling were not tapes or vinyl records, but the
  <strong>
   experience of sharing
   <br/>
   the music
  </strong>
  <strong>
   you enjoy, with like-minded people
  </strong>
  . As John Perry Barlow described it:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “… a lot of what we are selling is community.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   That is our main product, it’s not music”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  There was, of course, a balance here. The band still sold albums and built a
  <br/>
  business around branded merchandise. Allowing fans to record their concerts
  <br/>
  was an illustration that they put first their mission to share a musical experience,
  <br/>
  and not to simply “sell records”. But, back to the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest">
   “enlightened self-interest”
  </a>
  , it
  <br/>
  turns out that most of the band income was the result of concerts ticket sales,
  <br/>
  for which it was more important to ensure attendance. Allowing content sharing,
  <br/>
  turned out to become a mechanism for inexpensive marketing that brought more
  <br/>
  fans to their concerts.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Create a Business Tribe
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Again quoting John Perry Barlow:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Good communities are tribes.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   They have rituals and myths
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and those kind of deeper realities
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   that light up everyday reality and
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   give it some substance”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is consistent with the points that Jono Bacon makes in his book:
  <br/>
  <a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/about/">
   “The Art of Community”.
  </a>
  This involves: encouraging inclusiveness,
  <br/>
  avoiding micromanaging, promoting values, and building a
  <strong>
   sense of
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   belonging
  </strong>
  . It builds in one of the strongest and more primal human
  <br/>
  feelings:
  <strong>
   “nobody wants to be alone”
  </strong>
  . To make sense of the
  <br/>
  apparent absurdity of life, we all need to be part of something
  <br/>
  larger than ourselves. When we sell community, we all hunt together,
  <br/>
  and long term prosperity is secured. This is certainly a very natural
  <br/>
  lesson for open source businesses.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Insource
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Building a culture of Do It Yourself (DIY) inside an organization has
  <br/>
  multiple positive effects. It empowers the members to realize that
  <br/>
  they are in control of their destiny. It builds a culture of pride in
  <br/>
  what you do, it may not be perfect, but it was done with your own
  <br/>
  means, and it was done by someone who really cared about it.
  <br/>
  All of which contributes to raising the value of the organization for
  <br/>
  its tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Innovate Constantly
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “To stay ahead, a business must keep reinventing itself,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   keep working to change things for the better.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This continuous adaptation empowers the organization to be
  <br/>
  ahead of the curve. It is indeed harder than it sounds. Business
  <br/>
  would have to be willing to
  <strong>
   move out of cozy spots
  </strong>
  that have
  <br/>
  comfortable profitability, in the name of avoiding being trapped
  <br/>
  by practices that do not have long term viability.
 </p>
 <p>
  An example that comes to mind is the transformation of
  <strong>
   Red Hat
  </strong>
  ,
  <br/>
  when the
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhYMRtqvMg8">
   company moved away from selling Linux distributions,
   <br/>
   to selling subscriptions to services
  </a>
  . In that move, Red Hat
  <br/>
  abandoned what at the time was its most profitable product,
  <br/>
  and they did it with the vision that the subscription model
  <br/>
  would evolve into the more profitable product that it is today.
  <br/>
  With such changes Red Hat may become the first company
  <br/>
  based on a fully Open Source business model to reach the
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/196:zonker/528947:breaking-the-billion-barrier-why-red-hats-results-matter">
   $1 Billion mark in revenue by early 2012
  </a>
  . In their last quarter,
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.linux.com/images/stories/red-hat-q3-2011.png">
   85% of their revenue resulted from subscriptions
  </a>
  , and
  <br/>
  15% from services.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Transform Through Leadership
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Barnes tell us that:
  <em>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Jerry Garcia mastered the art of
   <strong>
    transformational leadership
   </strong>
  </em>
  ,
  <br/>
  <em>
   the ability to inspire greatness and bring about profound change”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Along the lines of “
  <strong>
   Grow your People
  </strong>
  “, or “Grow your Tribe”, the
  <br/>
  principle here is to build up the
  <strong>
   sense of belonging
  </strong>
  inside your
  <br/>
  own organization, and to raise the level of
  <strong>
   mastery
  </strong>
  , or at least
  <br/>
  the level of
  <strong>
   incremental mastery
  </strong>
  in its members. We all want
  <br/>
  to feel that we are becoming better at something every day. It
  <br/>
  gives us a sense of purpose. By creating a culture that celebrates
  <br/>
  self-improvement, and that challenges people to achieve greatness
  <br/>
  the organization becomes a very cohesive tribe, with empowered
  <br/>
  individuals that are able to handle strategic improvisation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Share the Power
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Sharing leadership through horizontal organizational structures
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   leads to better decision making and more loyal employees”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a principle well known and well understood in Open Source
  <br/>
  communities, but that has taken some time to take root in many
  <br/>
  organizations. In the book “
  <a href="http://freedomincbook.com/">
   Freedom Inc
  </a>
  “, Brian Carney and Isaac
  <br/>
  Getz illustrate many examples of organizations that successfully
  <br/>
  implemented horizontal structures and flattened hierarchies, that
  <br/>
  resulting in higher economic efficiency, and energetic innovation.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos argues that:
  <br/>
  <em>
   “It’s actually possible to run a values-based business
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   that also focuses on everyone’s happiness.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  It may sound like the 60’s,… but the fact remains that it results
  <br/>
  in profitable and innovative business. When employees refer to
  <br/>
  the company as “
  <em>
   We
  </em>
  ” as opposed to as “
  <em>
   They
  </em>
  “, you will know
  <br/>
  that you have succeeded.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Exploit the Experience Economy
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This one was probably the biggest revelation I found in the book.
  <br/>
  The concept of the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Experience_Economy">
   “
   <strong>
    <em>
     Experience Economy
    </em>
   </strong>
   “
  </a>
  , according to which,
  <br/>
  what many organization sell is the service of creating a memorable
  <br/>
  Experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, restaurants, do not just
  <em>
   “sell food”
  </em>
  . Instead, they sell
  <br/>
  the setting, the environment, the music, and the cultural context
  <br/>
  that comes with the food that is served in their premises.
  <br/>
  The Grateful Dead understood that what they were selling, was
  <br/>
  not music, but the the
  <em>
   experience of belonging to a tribe in which
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   the appreciation for music was a common shared value.
  </em>
  <br/>
  To build on this concept, companies must provide an
  <strong>
   authentic
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   experience
  </strong>
  that improves the lives of their tribe. This also involves
  <br/>
  begin transparent, keeping the passion for what you do, and
  <br/>
  keeping it real.
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  I can’t recommend Barnes’ book enough…
 </p>
 <p>
  It has the rare combination of an easy read, fascinating content,
  <br/>
  and transformational philosophy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, if you were brave enough to read thus far in this blog post,
  <br/>
  your reward is to enjoy some of the
