  Kitware has been awarded a Phase I SBIR from the Department of Energy entitled “Multi-Resolution Streaming for Remote Scalable Visualization.” This project expands upon Kitware’s expertise in Distance Visualization, which is becoming a critical area of research now that scientists and the massive amounts of data processed on supercomputers are often in two or more geographically separate locations. The goal of this Phase I award is to demonstrate a system that allows computational results to remain on the supercomputing system, while using a client-server architecture to process, analyze, and visualize the data. In order to achieve this goal, we will employ multi-resolution visualization methods that only load and display blocks of data, at the appropriate resolution, that are necessary for a particular visualization task.
