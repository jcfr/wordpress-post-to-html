  On Tuesday, April 24th, OSEHRA will host Tom Munnecke, one of the world’s leading  experts in health information technology, as he presents his  observations and lessons learned as one of the original architects of  VistA and CHCS, as well as his thoughts on their future evolution.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  He will present an architectural conceptual model based on an   “Information Space” rather than a “Integrated System.” In this model,   we approach the federal health information as a large-scale,   fine-grained network of information and interactions. He will also   discuss some of the unique issues of the massive scale in the federal   health care system – how we can use it to our advantage, as well as the   pitfalls it brings.
 </p>

  Join us from 12:30-1:45 PM EDT for Towards a Federal Health Information Space.
