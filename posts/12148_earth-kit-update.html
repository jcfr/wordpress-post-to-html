  Earth Kit is an open-source geospatial visualization library created through a contract with Sandia National Labs. Earth Kit is part of the new VTK view/representation architecture. This new architecture enables geographic visualizations to be easily integrated into applications that also have other visualization components. For example, an analyst may be interested in visualizing a network consisting of individuals and events. The Titan Informatics Toolkit’s “graph layout” view may be used in conjunction with an “Earth” view in order to visualize the network in different ways. The view selections will be linked, making it easy to correlate information in both views.

  Earth Kit is being used as part a prototype application being put together by the Computer Vision group to display video and tracks superimposed on the Earth. The work on this project began in the summer of 2007.
