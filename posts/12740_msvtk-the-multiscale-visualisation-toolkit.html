    MSVTK: the Multiscalar Visualisation Toolkit
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a pervasive trend in biomedical research towards the consideration of systemic processes; that is, phenomena observed in living organisms that cannot be explained within a single sub-system, but only as a systemic outcome resulting from the interaction of multiple sub-systems, e.g., using electro-chemical, cellular, blood perfusion, and anatomic information to understand cardiac diseases.  Traditionally, the complexity of the problems being investigated has forced concentration on individual sub-systems, and the most common boundary separating these individual studies has been the differing spatiotemporal scales at which they are observed / modeled.  Multiscale data collection and multiscale modeling have become synonymous with integrative research. Large efforts are being made toward the development of methods for multiscale data collection and analysis; however, such work must be accompanied with tools that allow investigators to visually explore those data collections or simulation results, defined across a broad range of spatial and/or temporal scales.
 </p>
 <p>
  MSVTK is an open-source software library based on
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/" style="line-height: 2em;">
   VTK
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.commontk.org/">
   CTK
  </a>
  for interactive visualisation of multi-scale and multi-temporal data. The library provides software components that are general enough to be potentially used in any biomedical software project with multiscale visualization issues. MSVTK extends VTK by adding new tools such as new VTK readers or widgets. The library also contains custom Qt/VTK widgets. Each tool is designed with the VTK paradigm in mind, so it can easily fit into any application already using VTK.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is a list of some of the MSVTK features:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Qt time player widget: a QSlider with play/pause/repeat buttons to control
    <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/c/c3/TimeVis-IEEE2007.pdf">
     time
    </a>
    in any VTK pipeline.
    <br/>
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Advanced VTK button: a vtkWidget that controls the renderer camera, supports advanced tooltip, and offers a convenient Qt interface.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Widget clustering manager: automatically show/hide a hierarchy of VTK buttons, based on camera viewpoint and/or spatial distribution, to reduce screen clutter.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Picking manager (already integrated into VTK 6.0): controls priorities for VTK widget user picks.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Level Of Detail (LOD) composite data reader: an on-demand caching mechanism to load/unload data at different LOD.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Fluid flow simulation: a VTK wrapper around
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ibamr/">
     IBAMR
    </a>
    , an open source, parallel memory implementation of the immersed boundary (IB) method, with support for Cartesian grid adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
   </span>
  </li>

   and many more…
