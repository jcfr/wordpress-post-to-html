 <p class="responsiveNews">
  At the conference, members of Kitware will demonstrate at the company booth (3437) how VTK and ParaView analyze and visualize data. VTK, for example, generates three-dimensional computer graphics, performs modeling, processes images, renders volumes and creates scientific and information visualizations. ParaView, which employs VTK as its data processing and rendering engine, explores large datasets on high-performance computing resources such as supercomputers. In fact, earlier this year, the

  “The development communities have made many impressive updates for VTK 7.1 and ParaView 5.2,” said
  <a href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5raXR3YXJlLmNvbS9jb21wYW55L3RlYW0vZGVtYXJsZS5odG1s" rel="nofollow">
   Dave DeMarle,
  </a>
  a staff research and development engineer at Kitware, who contributes to VTK and ParaView. “So far, over 70 community members have contributed 1,400 commits to VTK for version 7.1, and more than 50 community members have made over 600 commits to ParaView for version 5.2.”

  As the Kitware newsletter describes, ParaView has benefitted from the addition of two modules in VTK that support Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, respectively. With these devices, users can explore data in

   Ken Martin,
  </a>
  an original author of VTK, who leads the virtual reality work at Kitware. “It is incredibly natural and intuitive to explore a dataset in VR, and having that support in VTK and ParaView makes it accessible to a wide audience.”
 </p>
 <p class="responsiveNews">
  Along with VR, the development efforts for ParaView 5.2 and VTK 7.1 have focused on advanced rendering. In the upcoming release, VTK will formally introduce ray tracing through OSPRay, as well as Fast approXimate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA) and hidden line removal. The final release of ParaView 5.2 will also provide FXAA and hidden line removal.

  “It had been challenging to support anti-aliasing using multisampling in ParaView, as anti-aliasing can disrupt parallel rendering,” said
