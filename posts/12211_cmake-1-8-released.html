  For this release, the custom commands have been rearchitected to use a more understandable signature. The old signature should still work. ctest has been enhanced and can produce testing dashboards compatible with Dart in many cases. A new FILE command has been added that supports reading, writing, and globbing of files. A new help target is created for all Makefiles so you can do nmake help (or make help) Command line options (-D) for cmake no longer require the type of the argument. The on-line help for cmake has been significantly improved. Run cmake –help for more information. Support for windows paths and filenames that include &amp;. Support for files with multiple “.” in them for nmake. More Modules report results to CMakeOutput.log and CMakeError.log. The performance of dependency tracing and analysis in CMake has been significantly improved. Both ccmake and CMakeSetup have some minor GUI improvements. And of course a number of minor bug fixes and enhancements.
