  <strong>
   Why Rare Diseases ?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease" rel="nofollow">
   Rare diseases
  </a>
  are defined as those who afflict populations of less than 200,000 patients, or about 1 in 1,500 people.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are, however, about 7,000 rare diseases.
 </p>
 <p>
  The patients affected by them, and their families, struggle due to the lack of information and general knowledge on the nature and treatment for these afflictions.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It takes in average
   <strong>
    7.5 years
   </strong>
   for a patient to get a correct diagnosis for a rare disease,
  </li>
  <li>
   After having seen and average of
   <strong>
    8 doctors
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  By then, these patients have been treated for a variety of incorrect diagnosis and have missed the proper treatment for their case.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person’s entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.
