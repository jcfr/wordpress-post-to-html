  Studying examples is an excellent way to learn, especially for scientific software.  An example demonstrates explicitly how a concept works or how a given objective can be achieved. When code is coupled with documentation, all the critical details, which are difficult to encapsulate in prose, are immediately evident.

  Following on the outstanding work by lead David Doria and Bill Lorensen with the highly successful

  and

  Wiki Examples, an effort was made to improve the documentation technology for examples. The base platform for the new examples is the
  <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">
   Sphinx documentation generation system
  </a>
  .
 </p>

  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   The Sphinx tool was originally developed to be the native documentation system for the Python programming language, but it has been widely adopted by many other software documentation efforts, including projects in languages like C++. Sphinx documentation is written in a simple, easy to read and write markup language called
  </span>

   reStructuredText
  </a>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   . C
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   ontent in plain text reStructuredText input can be rendered into a variety of output formats, such as HTML, PDF, man pages, ePUB, etc. Sphinx has many nice features such as LaTeX equation rendering, code syntax highlighting, elegant output, quick search, extensive cross-referencing and index generation, and it is very extensible.

  This is the first in a series of articles that describes how Sphinx has been extended to create a powerful example documentation system, the
  <a href="http://itk.org/ITKExamples/">
   ITK Sphinx Examples
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The first feature to discuss is also one of the most important: automated, data-rich, visible acknowledgements via
  <a href="http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/">
   GitStats
  </a>
  . Since examples are developed in a Git repository, they automatically retain all the benefits of distributed version control. One these benefits is authorship metadata, including author name, email, commit times, and commit line changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  This metadata is analyzed with the popular GitStats tool. Community member Arnaud Gelas created an
  <a href="https://github.com/arnaudgelas/gitstats">
   output generator for GitStats that creates reStructuredText
  </a>
  .  The reStructuredText output is added to the Sphinx documentation, and since there is a clean separation of content and formatting, it
  <a href="http://itk.org/ITKExamples/Documentation/Credits.html">
   integrates nicely with rest of the documentation
  </a>
  .  There are
  <a href="http://itk.org/ITKExamples/Documentation/gitstats/index.html">
   overall stats
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://itk.org/ITKExamples/Documentation/gitstats/authors.html">
   author-centric statistics
  </a>
  , and
  <a href="http://itk.org/ITKExamples/Documentation/gitstats/activity.html">
   activity-centric stats
  </a>
  in textual, tabular, and graphic forms. These statistics are regenerated automatically on a nightly basis.
