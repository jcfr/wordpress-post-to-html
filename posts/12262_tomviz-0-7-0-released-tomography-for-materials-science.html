  We hosted Robert Hovden and Yi Jiang at a small hackathon yesterday, and had a productive day testing features, squashing bugs, and mapping out priorities over the next few months. Featured Visualization shown above by Yi Jiang: nanoparticles and mesoscale materials are simulated using the tomviz "Random Particle" generator. Features within the structure span all length scales.

   The tomviz project is developed as part of a collaboration between Kitware and Cornell University under DOE Office of Science contract DE-SC0011385. This is a community project, and we are very pleased to take input and contributions from all in the community.
