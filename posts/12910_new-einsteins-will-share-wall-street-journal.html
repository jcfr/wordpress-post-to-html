  We live in interesting times, when it is the
  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page">
   Wall Street Journal
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  the one that have to remind scientist that
  <strong>
   Sharing
  </strong>
  information is
  <br/>
  fundamental for promoting the progress of science and technology.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the article:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <span style="font-size: small;">
    “The New Einsteins Will Be Scientists Who Share”
   </span>
  </strong>
  <span style="font-size: small;">
   <br/>
   <em>
    “From cancer to cosmology, researchers could race ahead by working together—online and in the open
   </em>
   “

  <strong>
   Michael Nielsen
  </strong>
  introduces his argument with a recapitulation of
  <br/>
  the
  <a href="http://polymathprojects.org/">
   Polymath
  </a>
  project, and continue with several examples on how
  <br/>
  the
  <strong>
   public sharing
  </strong>
  of scientific information accelerates the process
  <br/>
  of discovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Some remarkable excerpts:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “These projects use online tools as cognitive tools to amplify our
   <br/>
   <strong>
    collective intelligence
   </strong>
   . The tools are a way of connecting the right
   <br/>
   people to the right problems at the right time, activating what would
   <br/>
   otherwise be latent expertise.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Or in Economic terms: achieve an efficient allocation of human
  <br/>
  resources to problems for which they are uniquely qualified and
  <br/>
  motivated.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Networked science has the potential to speed up dramatically
   <br/>
   the rate of discovery across all of science. We may well see
   <br/>
   the day-to-day process of scientific research change more
   <br/>
   fundamentally over the next few decades than over the past
   <br/>
   three centuries.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  But,… the article points out:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Despite the value of open data,
   <strong>
    most labs make no systematic
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    effort to share data
   </strong>
   with other scientists.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Why don’t scientist share?, will ask the surprised economist,
  <br/>
  who by professional training will hate to find that there is
  <br/>
  waste and inefficiency in any economic network…
 </p>
 <p>
  and the answer that emerges is:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “If you’re a scientist applying for a job or a grant, the biggest
   <br/>
   factor determining your success will be your record of
   <br/>
   <strong>
    scientific publications
   </strong>
   . If that record is stellar, you’ll do well.
   <br/>
   If not, you’ll have a problem. So you devote your working
   <br/>
   hours to
   <strong>
    tasks that will lead to papers in scientific journals
   </strong>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nielsen, rightfully identified the source of the problem:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “
   <strong>
    Even if
   </strong>
   scientists
   <strong>
    believe
   </strong>
   in the value of
   <strong>
    contributing,
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   they know that
   <strong>
    writing a single mediocre paper
   </strong>
   will do
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   far more for their careers.
   <strong>
    The incentives are all wrong
   </strong>
  </em>
  .”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  and even better, he points us in the right direction:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “If networked science is to reach its potential, scientists
   <br/>
  </em>
  <em>
   will have to
   <strong>
    embrace
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    reward
   </strong>
   the
   <strong>
    open sharing
   </strong>
   <br/>
   of
  </em>
  <em>
   <strong>
    all forms of scientific knowledge
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    not just traditional
   </strong>
   journal publication.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    …
   </strong>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Networked science must be open science.”
   </strong>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  and identify the actors that are essential for transforming
  <br/>
  the situation:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “A good start would be for
   <strong>
    government grant agencies
   </strong>
   (like the
   <br/>
   National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation)
   <br/>
   to work with scientists to
   <strong>
    develop requirements
   </strong>
   for the
   <strong>
    open sharing
   </strong>
   <br/>
   of
   <strong>
    knowledge
   </strong>
   that is discovered with
   <strong>
    public support.
   </strong>
   “
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The scientific community itself also has to do its part:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “
  </em>
  <em>
   …We have to
   <strong>
    overthrow
   </strong>
  </em>
  <em>
   the idea that it’s a diversion from “real”
   <br/>
   work
   <strong>
    when scientists conduct
   </strong>
  </em>
  <em>
   <strong>
    high-quality research in the open.
   </strong>
   “
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  and masterfully adds:
  <em>
   <br/>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    “Publicly funded science should be open science.”
   </em>
  </strong>

  Excellent reading for anyone involved in the process
  <br/>
  of scientific research.
