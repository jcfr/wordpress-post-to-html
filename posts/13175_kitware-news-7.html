     Google Tango Data Visualization
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware announced the release of a tutorial that describes how to use ParaView to extract, process, and visualize data from Google Project Tango development kits. The purpose of the tutorial is to promote faster development of the open Project Tango platform. The tutorial is published on Kitware's blog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the plugin and visualization capabilities of ParaView, users can interact with their Project Tango data without having to write a single line of code. For those who do not have Project Tango Development kits, the tutorial provides links to download sample data.
 </p>
 <p>
  The process starts with gathering data from the devices using the Android SDK. Then, this data is read into ParaView using a Tango-specific data plugin that is available as an open source download. The data is by nature 3D+time, meaning that it is a sequence of point clouds acquired over time. This data includes readings of the device position and orientation in 3D space, which indicate where the device was and the direction in which it was pointing at the moment a particular point cloud was acquired.
 </p>
 <p>
  After being loaded into ParaView, the point clouds are aligned and stitched together. ParaView can then use its animation capabilities to display the intermediate point clouds and how they contribute to reconstruct a larger area of space around the device. Filters are available from the Visualization Toolkit and the Point Cloud Library for advanced analysis. Example data sets are available for download on the MIDAS platform, along with installers for the customized ParaView builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware will continue exploring the use of the Project Tango devices for engineering, simulation, measurement, and medical applications.

     KWIVER WAMI Tracking System Released
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware announced the immediate availability of its state-of-the-art Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) tracking system on Forge.mil, as part of the Kitware Image &amp; Video Exploitation and Retrieval Toolkit (KWIVER). Full source code is available with unlimited rights, under the conditions of the DoD Community Source Usage Agreement, to anyone who can access Forge.mil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Kitware’s WAMI tracker in KWIVER is capable of producing tracks in real-time from WAMI across a wide range of resolutions and frame rates, by dynamically distributing processing across a compute cluster. The resulting data assists intelligence analysts as they support military operations, both live and forensically. Recently, Kitware's WAMI tracker was successfully transitioned to theatre as part of the Air Force's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system, where it produced tracks on downlinked WAMI in real-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Forge.mil is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) collaborative, government-open-source software hosting and development site supporting the technology development community. Membership in Forge.mil is available to DoD military and civilian employees and to DoD contractor personnel. By making Kitware’s tracking system available on Forge.mil, Kitware is providing the DoD software development community the opportunity to review and use the operationally deployed software under a Government Purpose Rights license.
 </p>
 <p>
  By placing its tracking technology on Forge.mil, Kitware is following its company-wide commitment to open-source software and scientific collaboration. Kitware intends to work with government and government contractor personnel to enhance the system and to help deploy its capabilities as part of other government projects. In addition to tracking technology, Kitware plans to add analytics to KWIVER from previous and ongoing government efforts. It is hoped that a software and algorithm development community will form around KWIVER, such that contributions from performers, government labs, and academia can be combined to create the best possible video analytics, freely available to everyone working with and within the US government.
 </p>

     New Capabilities Added to WAMI Utility
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Automatically detecting objects such as people and vehicles performing specific functions or complex activities is one of the most challenging problems in video analytics. Complex functional object recognition is required to detect objects that are defined by their behavior rather than their appearance, such as delivery trucks, police patrol vehicles, buses, and road cleaning vehicles. It is also used to detect complex threat patterns such as IED emplacement.
 </p>
 <p>
  During Phase II of the project "Vision with a Purpose: Inferring the Function of Objects in Video," Kitware created a prototype demonstration system to capture the power of human intuition by having users define complex functional objects' components, as well as the components' relationships, in a new graphical model. The model is then used to automatically and efficiently scan vast video scenes over long periods of time. In addition, the workflow enables users to share feedback to improve results. When example videos of functional objects are available, the system can also learn the core characteristics of their activities using machine learning techniques. The capability can be applied across diverse domains including wide-area motion imagery (WAMI), aerial full-motion video, and ground surveillance video.
 </p>
 <p>
  The research and development conducted for the workflow has produced crucial state-of-the-art technologies for vision-based recognition of functional objects. The core capabilities of these technologies include learning functional object models from examples using machine learning techniques, detecting known functional objects using a complex activity model, detecting anomalous functional objects, modeling relationships between locations and movers, and analyzing multi-scale patterns of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project's developments add new dimensions to the utility of WAMI videos and should play a crucial role in advancing the technologies utilized for national security and defense.

     Three GSoC Projects Accepted for VTK
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Three of the accepted Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2014 projects were proposed for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
 </p>
 <p>
  "Ensemble Vector Fields for VTK" was proposed by Brad Eric Hollister, who is working with Kitware's Berk Geveci. To add visualization support for ensemble vector fields, Brad plans on performing several tasks for the project. The first is "loading ensemble data from the NetCDF file format. The second is computation of finite-time variance analysis (FTVA) for an EVF. The third is to provide visualization of clusters in the variance data from FTVA. Lastly, as an optional item if time permits, is the inclusion of TRACLUS, a trajectory clustering algorithm for use within VTK."
 </p>
 <p>
  "Extensions for Geospatial and Climate based visualizations in VTK" was proposed by Jatin Parekh. For the project, Jatin is working with Kitware's Aashish Chaudhary. The goal of the project involves "adding a few extensions to the VTK library to support Geospatial and Climate based visualizations in the VTK library. The proposed work can be divided into four tasks: 1) Add new features to existing filters such as neat labelling of the contours. 2) New readers to read LIDAR dataset and GeoJSON geometry data into VTK. 3) Improve handling of time in VTK. 4) Implement tile rendering in VTK (optional – time permitting)."
 </p>
 <p>
  "Supporting a Visualization Grammar" was proposed by Marco Cecchetti. The goal of the project is to "provide the ability to create plots and charts with the VTK framework by a simple declarative language. In order to achieve this goal a visualization grammar similar to the one utilized by the Vega JavaScript library will be mapped to VTK data structures and to specific classes that will be designed for supporting geometry objects and marks." Marco is working with Kitware's Jeff Baumes for the project.
 </p>
