  “Incorporating Population-Level Variability in Orthopedic Biomechanical Analysis: A Review” was recently published in the
  <em>
   Journal of Biomechanical Engineering
  </em>
  .   The paper is co-authored by Jeffrey E. Bischoff and Yifei Dai from   Zimmer, Inc.; Casey Goodlett and Brad Davis from Kitware; and Marc Bandi   from Zimmer, GmbH.

  In  researching the orthopedic biomechanics of tissue or  joint behavior, it  is important to account for variability such as age,  gender, ethnicity,  and/or disease state. While this can be difficult  to accomplish,  according to the paper, we can use medical imaging,  biomechanical  testing, gait analysis, and computational analysis to  create models that  give us a better comprehension of how biomechanics  operates in regards  to health, disease, and reconstruction. Such an  understanding can aid in  joint disease care.
