  The DOD Army Research Lab has Awarded Kitware a Phase I STTR for accelerated data processing and rendering using GPU technologies. The focus of the work is to utilize the graphical processing unit to support of the ParaView visualization system. Recent advances in graphics hardware (and associated software libraries) enables the GPU to be programmed for a variety of tasks. This offers a significant opportunity for improving performance since GPUs have been previously relegated to rendering data; now they can be used for modeling and processing data.
