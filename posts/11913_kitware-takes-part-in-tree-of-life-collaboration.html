  Kitware is pleased to announce our role in the development of the open-source software  known as Arbor: Comparative Analysis Workflows for the Tree of Life. The  $2M project, funded by the National Science Foundation, will provide  researchers and scientists with workflow-based visualization and  analysis tools that will allow them to explore their vast quantities of  data to quickly understand how organisms are interrelated and how they  interact in geographical space and geological time.  This new  evolutionary-based research may help fuel future discoveries in the  fields of medicine, public health, agriculture, ecology, and genetics.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The project will be developed as part of a unique collaboration  between researchers at universities including the University of Idaho,  UC Berkeley, the University of Alabama, the University of Kansas, and  the University of Central Florida; and private industry researchers at  Kitware and KnowledgeVis.
 </p>

  Dr. Wesley Turner, Technical Leader at Kitware, will serve as the  principle liaison between Kitware and the other collaborators. He will  also lead the company’s efforts on the project, including the  integration of Arbor algorithms into an accessible, modular application;  the development of effective data visualization methods; and the  support necessary to nurture and grow an open-source community around  the platform.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  “We are incredibly excited to be part of such a big challenge,” said  Dr. Turner. “Arbor has the potential to radically improve life science  workflows and accelerate discovery in a variety of areas that are  crucial for improving human lives, while also gaining a better  understanding of the evolutionary process.”
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first version of Arbor is scheduled to be released later this  year, with updates and expanded operations to follow over the course of  the three years of funding.
