  Memorable Quote:

 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   “The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   is to think that you know what you are doing
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   because, once you think you know what you are doing
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   you stop looking around for other ways of doing things”
