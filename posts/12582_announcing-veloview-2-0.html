  Kitware and Velodyne are pleased to announce the release of version 2.0 of VeloView, the open-source visualization package for the Velodyne HDL sensor. The primary new feature of revision 2 is the ability to record and display positioning data such as GPS and IMU provided through the Velodyne system.  VeloView can now process and record positioning packets in addition to LiDAR return packets.  This enables new features such as:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Overhead display of recorded GPS trace
  </li>
  <li>
   Spreadsheet view and .csv export of GPS and IMU information
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The accuracy of these features depends on the quality of the GPS information recorded.
