   “Jonathan uses his high visibility in social media to advocate for open access by sharing links to discussions, mentioning
   <strong>
    open access
   </strong>
   articles and initiatives, and pushing for the opening up of popular closed access articles.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   This culture is shared with his students, who advocate for “open access” peer reviewing and created a
   <strong>
    peer-to-peer service
   </strong>
   for sharing bioinformatics material:
  </em>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    articles
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    software
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   and
   <strong>
    datasets
   </strong>
   .

 </ul>

  “In addition to just voicing his opinion,
  <br/>
  <strong>
   he also practices what he preaches
  </strong>
  ,
  <br/>
  by
  <strong>
   REFUSING TO PUBLISH IN NON-OPEN ACCESS journals
  </strong>
  .”
