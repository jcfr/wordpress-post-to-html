  .  It presents an integrated workflow for automated
  <em>
   in vivo
  </em>
  cell cycle profiling that enables large-scale, unbiased, consistent, and reproducible studies of the spatiotemporal effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and experimental perturbations on cell-cycle progression in living tissues at a single-cell level. The workflow combines a high-resolution intravital imaging setup for longitudinal observation of cell fate in living tissues with a novel computational framework for automated 3D segmentation and cell-cycle state identification of individual cell nuclei with widely varying morphologies, even those embedded in a highly complex tumor environment.
