  A critical bug affecting macOS Mojave that would cause Tomviz to crash on startup has been fixed, if you were having problems with Tomviz on macOS Mojave please try the new release and let us know if you experience any other issues. The
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/tomviz-1-4-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   live update support added for 1.4
  </a>
  has been improved. The time to preview image stack sizes was significantly reduced, and support for loading recently opened stacks was added. A number of speed improvements were made to decrease application startup time, and support for fixing the aspect ratio when exporting screenshots was added. Structural atomic data can now be loaded, and shown in the main 3D view, offering better support for atom probe tomography and atomic electron tomography applications.

  A huge thank you to the community for all of their support, we had a number of great meetings at Microscopy and Microanalysis this year, and continue to improve our software in response to community feedback. We have added templates for reporting issues on GitHub to make it easier to report issues, and continue to make improvements to our software.
