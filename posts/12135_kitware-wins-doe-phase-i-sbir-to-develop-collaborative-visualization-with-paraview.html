  Kitware has won a $100K Phase I SBIR with the Department of Energy. The proposed work aims to develop a parallel visualization system that will enable effective multiple remote collaborations for complex analysis in a large-scale data environment. We are partnering with the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). We expect to commercialize this work by using the open source ParaView project as a technology deployment platform. We will be commercializing add-on modules that extend ParaView to address domain-specific needs.
