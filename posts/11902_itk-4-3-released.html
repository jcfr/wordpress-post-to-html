   Kitware and the Insight Software Consortium are pleased to announce the  release of ITK 4.3, a major milestone that marks the hard work of  many community members.

   This release includes the addition of  experimental DICOM image reading via the DCMTK library as a backend, in  addition to the GDCM library. By default, DCMTK ImageIO support is not  enabled. To try DCMTK ImageIO support, turn the CMake option  Module_ITKIODCMTK ON. For Unix platforms, the supporting DCMTK library  will automatically be built as a CMake ExternalProject. On Windows, the  DCMTK library must be built independently of the ITK build system. Then,  specify the location to the external build after setting the CMake  option ITK_USE_SYSTEM_DCMTK ON.

   A number of registration-related feature enhancements were added. The  image registration methods have been updated to accommodate multiple  image metrics within a single optimization scheme. This permits, for  example, registration of a T1/T2 fixed image pair with a T1/T2 moving  image pair using a single metric for both T1 and T2 gradients, or even  using two different metrics. New exponential transforms are available  along with automated B-Spline transform scale estimation. A new  physics-based non-rigid registration class is also available.

   ITK 4.3 also contains a number of important bug fixes, including to  ObjectFactoryBase, Patch-Based Denoising improvements, support for a  system libtiff, mesh processing, and FFTW use. Support for  itk::VectorImage’s was added to many algorithms, and a single templated  Adaptor class can now be applied without modification to both  itk::VectorImage’s and itk::Image’s of itk::Vector’s, itk::RGBPixel’s,  etc.

   In addition, an extensive amount of code was removed and coding style  was made more consistent. Performance optimizations were achieved by  removing GetInput/GetOutput calls within filter inner loops, improving  memory alignment, memory access pattern optimizations, and  parallelization through threading. It is also important to note that as  previously scheduled, Visual Studio 2005 will no longer be supported  after this release.
