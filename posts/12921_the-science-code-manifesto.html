  Last week, we learned about the publication of the
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <a href="http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/">
    Science Code Manifesto
   </a>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  by
  <em>
   Nick Barnes
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  It eloquently states one of the principles
  <br/>
  that we have been living by at Kitware
  <br/>
  for more than a decade, and that defines
  <br/>
  our institutional purpose:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Software is a cornerstone of science.
   <br/>
  </em>
  <em>
   Without software,
   <br/>
   twenty-first century science would be impossible.
   <br/>
   Without better software,
   <br/>
   science cannot progress.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The manifesto also points out one of the major challenges
  <br/>
  that we confront on a daily basis, as we work to create better
  <br/>
  software and software practices for the scientific and academic
  <br/>
  communities:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “But the culture and institutions of science
   <br/>
   have not yet adjusted to this reality.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of these institutions live in denial, and participate in the
  <br/>
  scientific discours as if software was not an essential tool for it.
  <br/>
  We see papers published in Journals every month, for which we
  <br/>
  know that 90% of the work involved software development, and
  <br/>
  yet software is not mentioned in the paper, or much less, the
  <br/>
  software is not made available as part of the publication.
 </p>
 <p>
  Very few researches develop their code by following sound software
  <br/>
  engineering practices, such as revision control, unit testing, clear
  <br/>
  licensing, generous documentation, readability and maintainability.
 </p>
 <p>
  This disconnection between the practical reality of scientific research
  <br/>
  and the way its results are presented to the larger public, is an
  <br/>
  obstruction to the rapid progress of scientific research.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  We also see funding agencies disregarding the fundamental
  <br/>
  role that sound practices of software engineering play in the
  <br/>
  daily activities of scientific research.  Fortunately, some agencies,
  <br/>
  for example, The
  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">
   US National Library of Medicine
  </a>
  , have a more
  <br/>
  progressive and sound understanding of the importance of
  <br/>
  software as an indispensable research tool.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/">
   Science Code Manifesto
  </a>
  , rightfully goes on
  <br/>
  saying how we can change these institutions:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <br/>
   “We need to reform them to address this challenge,
   <br/>
   by adopting these five principles:”

  Nick Barnes explains how one of the elements that
  <br/>
  brought him to these principles was the influence of
  <br/>
  Free and Open Source Software.

  Eric Raymond said it nicely more than a decade ago:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Open Source is the application of the Scientific Method
   <br/>
   to the process of Software Development”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is now time for Open Source to bring back to Science
  <br/>
  the pragmatic practices of reproducibility and real peer
  <br/>
  review that have been the hallmark of science since the
  <br/>
  days of Galileo.
