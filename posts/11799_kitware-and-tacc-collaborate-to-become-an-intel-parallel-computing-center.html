  Today, HPC is widely recognized as a strategic capability of  fundamental importance to the economic strength and national security of  the United States and other developed countries, applicable to areas  ranging from engineering simulation to medical computing to climate  modeling. However, it can be difficult to deploy HPC at scale due to the  complexity of the programming model and the lack of reference  implementations with which to educate and accelerate the creation of new  software solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To address these challenges, the team of collaborators will work to  add support for Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor in VTK/ParaView. Adding  this capability to these well-established and widely adopted open-source  projects will not only provide easily deployable scalable solutions,  but will also serve as a working example for software developers to  study and extend.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The opportunity to become an Intel® Parallel Computing Center will  foster a collaboration between Kitware, TACC, and Intel that will  enhance ParaView to run more efficiently on the Intel® Xeon Phi™  Coprocessor platform,” Dr. Berk Geveci, Kitware’s Principal Investigator  for the project and Senior Director of Scientific Computing, said. “We  are honored to be part of such a critical effort in HPC.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the project, Kitware and TACC will optimize VTK/ParaView to  support Phi’s wide vector processing capability and to take advantage of  the large number of computing cores. The team will develop support for  both coarse and fine-grained parallelism, and will release open-source  software to demonstrate the use of these capabilities in a variety of  scientific computing applications. By leveraging the multi-core and  vector capabilities of the Intel® Xeon Phi™ coprocessors, the team will  demonstrate a significant increase in the performance of VTK/ParaView.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware’s scientific computing team will collaborate with TACC under  the leadership of its principal investigator, Dr. Paul A. Navrátil. Dr.  Navrátil is a Research Associate and the Manager of TACC’s Scalable  Visualization Technologies group. He is an expert in high-performance  visualization technologies and advanced rendering techniques, including  algorithms for large-scale distributed-memory ray tracing.
