   Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK)
  </a>
  is a library that exercises many corner cases for a C++ compiler. Dozens of compilers are validated nightly on the
  <a href="https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=Insight">
   CDash software quality dashboard
  </a>
  . Recently, the
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/itk-and-vtk-as-compiler-regression-test-cases/">
   Microsoft Visual Studio team added ITK
  </a>
  to its build validation suite. Similarly, Intel has now added ITK to the build validation suite for the
  <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers">
   Intel C++ Compiler
  </a>
  (ICC).

 <p>
  Jonathan Lefman, a leader at Intel Health and Life Sciences, coordinated improved support for ITK by the Intel team. The toolkit has driven improved compatibility in the compiler frontend and optimizations. Image registration in three or more dimensions is a high-performance computing problem, and acceleration of the widely adopted open-source ITK impacts medical image-based diagnosis across industry and academia.

  We look forward to working together with the Intel team to improve support for high-performance processors like the multi-core and many-core
