     VeloView 2.0 Released
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  The VeloView 2.0 release occurred at the SPAR International 3D Measurement &amp; Imaging Conference, which was held from April 14 to April 17, 2014, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
 </p>
 <p>
  New in version 2.0 of VeloView is the ability to record and display position packets. This capability is useful when a high accuracy GPS/IMU device is connected to the LiDAR sensor for geo-referencing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additional new features in version 2.0 include:
 </p>
 <p>
  •    Measurement tools: ruler and plane fitting
  <br/>
  •    Additional filtering options including laser selection and point subsampling
  <br/>
  •    Additional cameral controls
  <br/>
  •    Visualization of GPS track
  <br/>
  •    Display of multiple simultaneous frames
 </p>
 <p>
  More information on how Kitware and Velodyne have worked together on the development of VeloView is in the “Velodyne: A Case study in Open-Source Solutions” article on page six.
 </p>
 <p>
  VeloView 2.0 and its source code can be downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VeloView, and sample data is located on http://midas3.kitware.com/midas/community/29. The VeloView 1.0 and VeloView 2.0 release videos can be found on Kitware’s Vimeo page.

     CMake 3.0.0 Released
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Significant changes were made to CMake in version 3.0. For example, the CMake language was extended with *Bracket Argument* and *Bracket Comment* syntax whose contents are not evaluated by CMake, and the CMake documentation was converted to reStructuredText.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the “add_library()” command learned a new “INTERFACE” library type, the “export()” command learned a new “EXPORT” mode that retrieves the list of targets to export from an export set configured by the “install(TARGETS)” command “EXPORT” option, and the “project()” command learned to set some version variables to values specified by the new “VERSION” option or to empty strings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The source and binaries for CMake 3.0 are available to download from cmake.org. The documentation and the release notes can be found under the Help menu on CMake’s website.

    <strong>
     Final Bender 2.0 Release Candidate
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware is pleased to announce the final release candidate for Bender 2.0. Features in version 2.0 include a new approach to posing anatomical models by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The numerical solution enabled by FEM allows the anatomy to be correctly repositioned, while preserving the volume of each organ.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two highly successful open-source projects were integrated to provide the new features found in Bender 2.0: Cleaver (for generating multi-material tetrahedral meshes from labelmap volumes) and SOFA (for its extensive simulation engine and collision detection).
 </p>
 <p>
  The binaries for the release candidate are available on http://packages.kitware.com/folder/135. The code can be found on http://public.kitware.com/gitweb?p=Bender/Bender.git, and the documentation is on the Bender Wiki page.
