  “On March 29 &amp; 30, NASA will host its first Open Source Summit at  Ames Research Center in Mountain View California. This event will bring  together engineers and policy makers across NASA and respected members  of the
  <strong>
   open source
  </strong>
  community to discuss the challenges with the existing
  <strong>
   open source policy framework
  </strong>
  , and propose
  <strong>
   modifications
  </strong>
  that would make  it easier for NASA to develop, release, and use open source software.”
