  Kitware is pleased to announce the release of VTK 5.6.1, a patch release over 5.6.0 with a small set of improvements.
 </p>
 <p>
  VTK now includes NetCDF 4.1.1 allowing users to take advantage of the latest enhancements to NetCDF. Additionally, the C++ version of the library is also included. A new file format, MPAS, has been added; it is a netcdf-based reader for ocean and atmosphere datasets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Charts have significant improvements in axes layout and  the ability to display multiple data series (up to four) in the same plot. Initial support for linked selection has  been added to the charts in VTK and ParaView. Support for alpha blending in parallel coordinate plots has also been added.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve cleaned up VTK’s build and install rules so that developers don’t have to worry about ‘rpath’ anymore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, “make install” has been vastly improved on all platforms.
 </p>
