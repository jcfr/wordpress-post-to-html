  Kitware is pleased to announce the release of Girder 1.3.0, a data science tool that supports scalable data management solutions. With this release, Girder can run on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. Also new with this release is the ability for clients to upload to an S3 assetstore, as they would any other assetstore type, if they do not implement the direct-to-S3 upload behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Further highlights of the release include the ability via the REST API and the web client to apply an access control list to all children of a collection or folder recursively, the ability via the REST API and the web client to download an entire collection as a zip archive, and the addition of utilities to the JavaScript library for dynamically changing the page layout during navigation.
