     Dr. Hoogs Presents Computer Vision Papers at IEEE Workshop
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Anthony Hoogs, Kitware's Senior Director of Computer Vision, presented three papers at the 2014 IEEE Applied Imagery and Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop. The workshop was held in Washington, DC, from October 14 to October 16, 2014.
 </p>
 <p>
  For "Multi-Target Tracking in Video with Adaptive Integration of Appearance and Motion Models," Dr. Hoogs discussed a hybrid tracking architecture that utilizes motion detections to robustly initialize multiple tracks. The tracking architecture also uses a blended approach to integrate appearance-based trackers, provides a generalized API for interfacing such trackers, and adaptively uses motion detection or appearance match to update a track. The paper's authors are Arslan Basharat, Ilker Ersoy, Kannappan Palaniappan, Anthony Hoogs, and Gunasekaran Seetharaman.
 </p>
 <p>
  For "KWiver: A Open-Source Cross-Platform Video Exploitation Framework," Dr. Hoogs introduced KWiver, a cross-platform video exploitation framework that Kitware has begun releasing as open source. The paper's authors include Keith Fieldhouse, Matthew J. Leotta, Arslan Basharat, Russell Blue, David Stoup, Charles Atkins, Linus Sherrill, Benjamin Boeckel, Paul Tunison, Jacob Becker, Matthew Dawkins, Matthew Woehlke, Roderic Collins, Matt Turek, and Anthony Hoogs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Hoogs also presented "Towards visual analysis of unconstrained images in social forums: Studies on concept detection and personalized economy of images in social networks." The paper's authors are Sangmin Oh, Eric Smith, Yiliang Xu, and Anthony Hoogs.

     Kitware Works with NVIDIA to Drive HPC Visualization
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware announced that it is working with NVIDIA to develop several powerful enhancements for the field of high-performance computing (HPC) visualization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among these is a new Visualization Toolkit (VTK) rendering backend, which targets graphics processing units (GPUs) and takes advantage of the flexible programmable pipelines available in modern systems. This development has already resulted in significant improvements in rendering performance, especially with large geometries (20 million+ triangles) that can now be rendered over 100 times faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Through our collaboration with NVIDIA, we will enhance the open-source VTK and ParaView to better serve the HPC visualization community,” said Dr. Berk Geveci, Kitware’s Senior Director of Scientific Computing.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, as part of the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) project “XVis: Visualization for the Extreme-Scale Scientific-Computation Ecosystem," Kitware, in collaboration with government labs and academia, is developing a unified visualization library, named VTK-m, as a single point to collaborate, contribute, and leverage massively threaded visualization algorithms. Kitware will be demonstrating VTK-m in NVIDIA GPU-accelerated applications in in situ mode within ParaView Catalyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  NVIDIA will add future EGL support to its drivers, eliminating the need to install an X server for graphics output in ParaView. The companies are also exploring bringing OptiX parallel ray tracing and volume visualization capabilities into ParaView for better insight into simulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  This collaboration will enable VTK and ParaView to fully benefit from the huge computational and graphics performance NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro architectures provide.

     Dr. Enquobahrie Sheds Light on Need for Community Infrastructure in mHealth
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  On October 29, 2014, Dr. Andinet Enquobahrie participated in the National NSF workshop on Computing Challenges in Future Mobile Health (mHealth) Systems, which was held at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. During the presentation, Dr. Enquobahrie shared Kitware's experience in developing software and community building tools for the medical imaging and EHR communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Enquobahrie discussed with the workshop's participants that a publicly accessible mHealth database and a robust community infrastructure will foster collaborations between mobile health researchers and computational scientists. In order to create a robust infrastructure that is sustainable and effective, however, key technical considerations must be taken into account during the design process. Such considerations include user-friendly and flexible access, the capability to handle heterogeneous data, a unified API, and standardized baseline algorithms.
 </p>
 <p>
  To build a community around the database, it is important to find mutually beneficial incentives for collaboration between public health researchers, computer scientists, computational scientists, clinicians, and healthcare administrators. It is also critical to build trust among the community's members and to develop a common purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other key considerations discussed during the workshop were the benefits of a strong collaborative multidisciplinary research community, the major challenges in building a strong community, the best practices to initiate and nurture a vibrant and active community, and the role of open science (open data, open model, and open-source software).
 </p>
 <p>
  The overall takeaway from Dr. Enquobahrie's presentation is that a well-designed publicly accessible database and collaboration infrastructure will encourage robust collaboration among researchers and lead to successful data-driven healthcare solutions.

     Kitware and TACC Collaborate to Become Intel® Parallel Computing Center
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware has recently become an Intel® Parallel Computing Center in collaboration with Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). This team will focus its efforts on supporting the Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor in ParaView and in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, HPC is widely recognized as a strategic capability of fundamental importance to the economic strength and national security of the United States and other developed countries, applicable to areas ranging from engineering simulation to medical computing to climate modeling. However, it can be difficult to deploy HPC at scale due to the complexity of the programming model and the lack of reference implementations with which to educate and accelerate the creation of new software solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To address these challenges, the team of collaborators will work to add support for the Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor in VTK/ParaView. Adding this capability to these well-established and widely adopted open-source projects will not only provide easily deployable scalable solutions, but will also serve as a working example for software developers to study and extend.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The opportunity to become an Intel® Parallel Computing Center will foster a collaboration between Kitware, TACC, and Intel that will enhance ParaView to run more efficiently on the Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor platform,” Dr. Berk Geveci, Kitware’s Principal Investigator for the project and Senior Director of Scientific Computing, said. “We are honored to be part of such a critical effort in HPC.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the project, Kitware and TACC will optimize VTK/ParaView to support Phi’s wide vector processing capability and to take advantage of the large number of computing cores. The team will develop support for both coarse and fine-grained parallelism and will release open-source software to demonstrate the use of these capabilities in a variety of scientific computing applications. By leveraging the multi-core and vector capabilities of the Intel® Xeon Phi™ coprocessors, the team will demonstrate a significant increase in the performance of VTK/ParaView.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware’s scientific computing team will collaborate with TACC under the leadership of its Principal Investigator, Dr. Paul A. Navrátil. Dr. Navrátil is a Research Associate and the Manager of TACC’s Scalable Visualization Technologies group. He is an expert in high-performance visualization technologies and advanced rendering techniques, including algorithms for large-scale distributed-memory ray tracing.

     Kitware Fuels Scientific Discovery with ASCR Awards
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware recently announced its collaboration on three Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) awards from the Department of Energy (DOE).
 </p>
 <p>
  The awards are part of the ASCR Computer Science program, which supports research that enables computing at extreme scales and the understanding of extreme-scale data from both simulations and experiments. Recently, the program announced nine new awards under Scientific Data Management, Analysis &amp; Visualization at Extreme Scale 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are honored to be selected for three of the ASCR awards,” Dr. Berk Geveci, Kitware’s Principal Investigator on two of the projects and the company’s Senior Director of Scientific Computing, said. “The Computer Science program is important because it addresses key areas in the field of scientific computing, including high-performance computing (HPC) and extreme-scale simulations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  For the first project, “XVis: Visualization for the Extreme-Scale Scientific-Computation Ecosystem,” Kitware will collaborate with Sandia National Laboratories, under the leadership of Principal Investigator Ken Moreland; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Los Alamos National Laboratory; University of California Davis; and University of Oregon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The team will build a unified visualization library, named VTK-m, as a single point to collaborate, contribute, and leverage massively threaded visualization algorithms. The motivation behind the project is the shift in HPC toward the increasing use of accelerators and other processor technologies that use greater concurrent threading to overcome physical limitations of power and latency.
 </p>
 <p>
  Building on top of this foundation, the XVis project will research techniques for flyweight in situ components, advanced data models, new domain challenges, and post hoc interaction techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly, on the “Scalable Analysis Methods and In Situ Infrastructure for Extreme Scale Knowledge Discovery” project, Kitware will collaborate with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, under the leadership of PI Wes Bethel; Argonne National Laboratory; Georgia Institute of Technology; and JMSI, Inc.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project will address a set of research challenges for enabling scientific knowledge discovery within the context of in situ processing at extreme-scale concurrency. The work is motivated by a widening gap between FLoating-point Operations Per Second and input/output (I/O) capacity, which will make full-resolution, I/O-intensive post hoc analysis prohibitively expensive, if not impossible. The team will focus on developing new algorithms for analysis and visualization that are suitable for use in an in situ context aimed specifically at enabling scientific knowledge discovery in several exemplar application areas of importance to the DOE.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly, Kitware will collaborate with Los Alamos National Laboratory, under the leadership of Principal Investigator Pat McCormick; Sandia National Laboratories; University of Utah; and Stanford University on the project “A Unified Data-Driven Approach for Programming In Situ Analysis and Visualization.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The overarching goal of the project is the study of a unified data-driven approach for programming applications, as well as in situ analysis and visualization. In particular, the team will focus on the interplay between data-centric programming model requirements at extreme scale and the overall impact of those requirements on the design, capabilities, flexibility, and implementation details for both applications and the supporting in situ infrastructure.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We are looking forward to collaborating with world-renowned organizations on projects that will significantly advance scientific discovery,” Geveci said.
 </p>

     Virtual Surgery System Aims to Help Surgeons Treat Craniosynostosis
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware is developing software for treatment planning and evaluation of craniosynostosis through robust, quantitative, and reproducible methods that assess cranial shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures. It occurs in approximately one in 2,000 live births and results in cranial malformation that can lead to elevated intra-cranial pressure and brain growth impairment. It can also lead to developmental deficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the most common treatment option for craniosynostosis is surgery, today’s surgical treatment planning is mostly qualitative, subjective, and irreproducible. In addition, although virtual planning has been successfully introduced in niche areas of craniofacial surgery, such as corrective jaw surgery applications, there exists a need for clinical tools that provide accurate and reproducible evaluation of cranial morphology to guide cranial vault remodeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “To cover the gap in current clinical practice, we will develop personalized technology for preoperative planning for infants with craniosynostosis,” Dr. Andinet Enquobahrie, Kitware’s Principal Investigator for this project and Assistant Director of Medical Computing, said. “The technology will help decrease operative time and blood loss to reduce perioperative morbidity and facilitate an optimized and more durable long-term outcome.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of the Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project funded by the National Institutes of Health is to design, develop, and validate a virtual surgery system for optimal treatment planning for cranial remodeling. To accomplish this goal, the team will create a normative multi-atlas database that captures a wide breadth of normal variations on cranial shape and patient ages. The team will also develop image processing, statistical shape analysis, and biomedical modeling algorithms to identify desirable post-operative skull shapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project is a collaboration between Kitware and Children’s National Health System in Washington, DC. Children's National is an internationally recognized pediatric hospital, with over 140 years of experience, and a center of excellence in the treatment of birth defects and the clinical management of craniosynostosis. Children’s National is also home to the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, which is devoted to advancing the frontiers of pediatric surgery.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The impact of this technology is reduced perioperative morbidity and lower treatment costs,” Dr. Marius Linguraru, the Principal Investigator for the project and a Principal Investigator and Director of the Quantitative Imaging Group of the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, said. “The technology will also enable the precise, quantitative comparison of measurements before and after cranial vault reconstruction to determine the efficacy and durability of specific reconstructive techniques.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The project will build upon Kitware’s extensive experience in the field of surgical guidance. As the primary developer of Image Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK), Insight Registration and Segmentation Toolkit (ITK), and 3D Slicer, Kitware has demonstrated leadership in the creation, integration, and support of state-of-the-art medical data visualization and analysis technology.
