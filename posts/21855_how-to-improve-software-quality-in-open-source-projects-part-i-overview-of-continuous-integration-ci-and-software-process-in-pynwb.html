   Writing quality software requires you to have craftsmanship as well as technical expertise. While writing code is a demanding activity, you can automate portions of the day-to-day tasks to help reduce errors. By adding automated software quality processes, you can further increase the maintainability and readability of your project, which can help you build a community around and encourage contributions to open source software.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   To support software quality, it is critical that you have a

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   (CI).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   CI automates critical software process tasks such as compiling software, running tests, releasing and deploying software and storing artifacts. In CI, these tasks are invoked persistently as you make changes to the software. CI builds may be triggered when you push a commit to a source code repository, for example, or when you merge a topic branch into your master branch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   In this blog series, we will explore the benefits that cloud-based CI provides. The actual examples are based on the software quality processes that we added to

   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    PyNWB
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   , an open source software project. The examples present a guide for better understanding the tooling used in PyNWB.

   PyNWB
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   PyNWB is a Python software library that provides a high-level application programming interface (API) for working with files stored in the

    NWB format
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   . NWB is a unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data. It focuses on the dynamics of groups of neurons that are measured under a large range of experimental conditions. The NWB format comes from the

   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N)
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   project, which consists of neuroscientists and software developers who recognize that the adoption of a unified data standard is an important step toward breaking down the barriers to sharing, reusing and reproducing data.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   The goal is to have PyNWB be as accessible to as many researchers as possible. By adding automated tooling to the CI process, we enabled PyNWB to support Python 2 and Python 3; be usable on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems; and be packaged to both PyPI and Conda-forge. To do so, we needed to test PyNWB on multiple platforms. Without automated tooling, it would have been far too much manual labor for us to keep up with our goal and pursue code development.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   In addition to making PyNWB accessible, we aim to encourage good quality and consistency in the codebase to ensure that PyNWB is maintainable. As a result, we added style enforcement in our CI tests, and we automatically build the documentation as part of our CI process.

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Moving forward, this blog series will offer a general overview of the PyNWB CI process, but it will not cover all of the setup steps in detail. The creation and management of user accounts, as examples, may be more idiosyncratic based on the needs of specific projects. Instead, we will focus on these topics:
  </span>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    cross-operating system support, Python 2 and Python 3 support, source distributions and dependency versioning;
   </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    code coverage, documentation and style; and
   </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    real-world considerations, including the challenges of maintaining services.
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   To be clear, simply using the techniques described in this series wonâ€™t result in good code. Writing maintainable and understandable code is like walking on a tightrope, and the tools in this post are like an umbrella. They can help you reach your destination by improving your balance, but they are not enough to save you from falling.
