    Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior. From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of

   Today’s

   the copying of articles from Academic Journals as a

    Felony

   (that is, at the same level as murder, treason, or drug trafficking), and to charge offenders with

    statutory damages as high as $150,000 per infringement

   .

   It is time to
