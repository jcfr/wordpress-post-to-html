    As part of the Kitware Gives Back initiative, we held our annual blood drive at our Kitware headquarters in Clifton Park, New York today. We saw many of the same faces from our office and surrounding businesses return to donate.

    This year we brought in 22 donors. The Red Cross was able to collect a total of 19 pints of blood. Our total numbers for donors and pints collected did drop a bit but the drive was considered a success. The summer is a rough time of year for the Red Cross, and the many times shortages of blood and platelets occur. If you were not able to donate today please visit
