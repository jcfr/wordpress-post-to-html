  Berk Geveci, Utkarsh Ayachit and Dave DeMarle from Kitware and Ken Moreland and John Greenfield from Sandia National Labs will be presenting a tutorial on “Large Scale Visualization with Paraview” on Monday November 17 during the Supercomputing 2008 conference.  This tutorial presents the architecture of ParaView and the fundamentals of parallel visualization. Attendees will learn the basics of using ParaView for scientific visualization with hands-on lessons.  The tutorial will provide an introduction to scripting and extending ParaView and provide attendees with detailed guidance for visualizing the massive simulations run on today’s supercomputers.  Attendees should bring laptops to the tutorial so that they may install ParaView and follow along with the demonstrations.

  ParaView is a powerful open-source turnkey application for analyzing and visualizing large data sets in parallel.  Regularly used by Sandia National Laboratories analysts to visualize simulations run on the Red Storm and ASC Purple supercomputers and by thousands of other users in worldwide, ParaView is designed to be configurable, extendible, and scalable.  In order to allow for the rapid deployment of visualizations components, ParaView is built upon the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
