  Kitware, Inc. has been contracted by the National Library of Medicine to develop an automated journal publishing system for the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. The goal of this work is to set of a process that enables developers of ITK to automatically submit work consisting of software, data and documentation. The system will evaluate the quality of the submission (i.e., the quality of the code), and automatically incorporate it into the journal if the work passes muster. Users will also be able to read and rate the quality of the submission; insuring that the best work receives the greatest publicity.
