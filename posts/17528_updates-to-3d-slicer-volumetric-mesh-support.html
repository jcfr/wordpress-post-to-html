   previous blog post
  </a>
  , the addition of volumetric mesh support to 3D Slicer was announced. In this post, we report two new features to better visualize 3D volumetric meshes: 1) An integrated model clipping method for both surface and volumetric meshes and 2) Opacity control for 2D slice intersections of models.

 <h2>
  Integrated model clipping method
 </h2>
 <p>
  When volumetric mesh support was added to 3D Slicer, volumetric and surfaces meshes were clipped using two distinct methods. Surface meshes were clipped to a smooth surface (i.e. the displayed mesh would contain “partial” cells from the source mesh), while volumetric meshes were clipped to only display whole cells. The recent update allows both mesh types to be clipped with either method using an option in the Models module, and provides an additional clipping option available through the API.
  <br/>
  The

   ClippingTypeMethod
  </span>
  member variable has been added to
  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">
   vtkMRMLClipModelsNode
  </span>
  to control the selection of different clipping methods. The MRML node currently supports three clipping options: Straight (matches clipping plane exactly, leaving partial cells in view); Whole cells (boundary cells that cross the clipping plane are removed); and whole cell including boundary cells (boundary cells are preserved). Straight clipping is implemented using

   vtkClipPolyData
  </span>
  and
  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">
   vtkClipDataSet
  </span>
  for surface and volumetric meshes, respectively. Whole cell extraction clipping is implemented using

  </span>
  and

  Opacity control for 2D slice intersection in models
 </h2>
 <p>
  To improve visualization of volumetric meshes alongside volume data, independent control of the opacity of 2D slice intersections has been added to the Models module. The source changes for the update can be found
