  I am very pleased to announce that the
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">
   Visualization Toolkit
  </a>
  was accepted as a mentoring organization for the
  <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html">
   Google Summer of Code 2011
  </a>
  . We have an
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/GSoC">
   ideas page
  </a>
  where students can look at the ideas we came up with, and potential mentors can add new ideas (please discuss them with us first). This is a great opportunity for students to get involved with a big open source project, that is cross platform and well tested across a large number of architectures. It is also a great opportunity for us to grow as a community, and welcome new contributors.

 <p>
  If you are a student you should check out the
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/GSoC">
   ideas page
  </a>
  and the project
  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline">
   timeline
  </a>
  . The ideas are just suggestions; if you have others discussing them on the VTK developers list would be a good idea, and would help with finding potential mentors for the project. Once student applications open up you should
  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/">
   register
  </a>
  and prepare your proposal. It would also be a great idea to frequent the mailing lists,
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Git/Simple">
   clone the source code
  </a>
  and ensure you can get everything built.

 <p>
  We are very pleased to have the opportunity to take part in the Google Summer of Code program. I encourage students to get in touch early and feel free to ask questions on the mailing lists. We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals and canâ€™t wait to start working with a new generation of open source developers in what is one of the oldest open source C++ projects on the web.
