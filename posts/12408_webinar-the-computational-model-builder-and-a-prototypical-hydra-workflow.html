   Description
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Sophisticated CFD simulators such as Hydra can simulate complex physical phenomena and can be applied to a large spectrum of problems.  However, defining the input for these systems can be a somewhat daunting task and can result in both a high learning curve and a large number of “mistakes” in defining the simulation. Computational Model Builder, or CMB for short, is a flexible, configurable, open-source application framework that has been developed to address the complexities of defining the inputs of these simulations.  The ModelBuilder application based on CMB’s framework provides an easily customizable graphical user interface for viewing model/mesh geometry as well as for specifying boundary conditions, material properties, and other information required by an analysis. In this webinar, we will show how ModelBuilder was customized for Hydra and will demonstrate how to set up a Hydra simulation using the application.
