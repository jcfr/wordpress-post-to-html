    ITK Increases Support and Gains Remote Modules in Version 4.11
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  The development team for the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) released version 4.11.0 to offer exciting features thanks to the contributions of over 30 community members. Among its highlights, the release enabled NumPy bridge support by default. The support permits NumPy array views of multi-component images as well as vectors and matrices. The release also added a filter for edge enhancement,

   itk::UnsharpMaskImageFilter
  </span>
  , and it updated the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) library and other third-party libraries to the latest upstream versions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, ITK acquired a number of remote modules. These modules perturb mesh vertices with additive Gaussian noise; accurately benchmark computational performance; complete principal component analysis of scalar, vector, and mesh vertex data; create a run-length encoded memory compression scheme for

  ; run n-dimensional morphological contour interpolation; interpolate multi-label images; iterate over multiple images simultaneously; and compute an inverse displacement field, respectively.
