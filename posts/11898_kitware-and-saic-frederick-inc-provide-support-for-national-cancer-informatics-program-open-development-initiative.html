  Kitware today  announces the award of a subcontract with SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F)  to migrate a collection of National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored  software projects to an open-source environment in Github.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  With 14 years of experience in cultivating open-source software  projects and associated communities, Kitware will play an advisory role  in this project and provide NCI and SAIC-F personnel with knowledge,  tools, and skills for successfully managing the migration process and  implementing strategies for community growth and support.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  End results from this six-month project will include a set of  well-defined standard operating procedures detailing the process of  migrating projects from subversion (SVN) repositories hosted at NCI to a  National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) space hosted in Github.  In-house teams at NCI and SAIC-F will be trained with skills and  methodologies for fostering these communities, and applying open-source  practices to existing projects funded by NCI and other supporting  organizations.

  “We are thrilled that Government agencies are embracing open-source  practices, and are starting to appreciate how important community  building is while software is being developed,” said Dr. Luis Ibáñez,  Technical Leader at Kitware and Community Development Advisor for this  project. “Self-directed communities attract individuals who want to do  the work merely because they are interested in a project, and the  feelings of autonomy, mastery, and purpose they get from contributing.  Bringing these projects to an open-source environment, where communities  can become self-sufficient, is a great way of serving the public  interest.”
