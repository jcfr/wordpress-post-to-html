  Kitware has received a two-year grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling more than $600,000 to focus research efforts on developing approach-specific, multi-GPU, multi-tool, high-realism neurosurgery simulation. The goal of the research is to work toward an interactive simulator that replicates future neurosurgery cases of young surgeons, enabling hospitals faced with compressed intern schedules to accelerate training and improve skills.

  “Simulation has made limited inroads in neurosurgery despite its proven advantages over traditional surgical training,” said Dr. Michel Audette, R&amp;D Engineer at Kitware. “Our objective is to empower the neurosurgical field with simulation training methods that directly correlate to better, more accurate patient care.”
  <br/>
  Historically, simulation has over-emphasized needle insertion and failed to address requirements of surgeons-in-training on potential caseloads. Existing simulators do not ably reconcile the conflicting clinical requirements of neurosurgery; their underlying models are insufficiently sparse to resolve large tissue displacements and they are insufficiently descriptive of critical tissues at risk in each intervention.
