  The event will take place
  <strong>
   December 19-20, 2013
  </strong>
  at
  <a href="http://rpi.edu/">
   Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
  </a>
  ’s state-of-the-art Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (
  <a href="http://empac.rpi.edu/">
   EMPAC
  </a>
  ) and bring together program experts, data experts, public health providers, academia, and other public health stakeholders with tech gurus and app developers for a “technology brainstorming session,” using
  <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/">
   DOH open health data
  </a>
  and other valuable data.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purpose of the event is to generate ideas on how to use
  <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/browse">
   data
  </a>
  to help New Yorkers prevent the development of
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Obesity and
  </li>
  <li>
   Diabetes.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Both conditions are
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/">
   chronic diseases
  </a>
  that require lifelong management by the patient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chronic diseases are known to account for
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/">
   75% of the health care cost
  </a>
  (for close to
  <strong>
   2
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Trillion
  </strong>
  dollars a year).
 </p>
 <p>
  When people can take charge of their food choices and adopt a more active lifestyle, they can reduce the risk for overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes and other associated health risks. In fact, a full 95% of chronic disease care occurs outside the health care system.

 <p>
  New York State is a leader in the Nation on making
  <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/">
   Health Data publicly available
  </a>
  in it site

  Here is a quick example, of what open data makes possible:

  Using the public data set:

 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">
   Socrata
  </a>
  platform supports the generation of visualization such as:

  The same dataset can be downloaded in a variety of formats, including

    JSON

    RDF
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>

  to be processes by local applications.

  In the following days we will share examples on how to use the

   Socrata API
  </a>
  to create basic Apps that bring Health Data to life.
