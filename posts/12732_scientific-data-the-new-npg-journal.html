  The Reproducible Research movement has been, for many years,
  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now.html">
   raising awareness about the importance of Open Data
  </a>
  , and the need for
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/open-science-now/">
   changing the reward system
  </a>
  in academic research to give credit to those who generously share data with the larger community.
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, there has been a need for publication venues where research groups can submit the outcomes of
  <strong>
   pure data  gathering
  </strong>
  , and in this way get the research credits they deserve. In the absence of such venues, it has been a common practice for researchers to
  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now.html">
   delay the sharing of data
  </a>
  until they can analyze it and produce results that are publishable in traditional journals, a process that typically take years.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a
  <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/scientificdata/2013/04/03/if-not-now-then-when-my-view-from-within/">
   revolutionary move
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  Yesterday, the Nature Publishing Group (NPG)
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificdata.html">
   announced
  </a>
  the Spring 2014 launch of the new Journal
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <span class="journalname" style="font-size: large;">
   <a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/">
    Scientific Data
   </a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Scientific Data is a new
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Open-access
  </li>
  <li>
   Online-only platform
  </li>
  <li>
   for the publication of descriptions of scientifically valuable datasets
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="journalname">
   Scientific Data
  </span>
  will initially focus on experimental datasets from the
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Life
  </li>
  <li>
   Biomedical and
  </li>
  <li>
   Environmental science communities
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  with future plans to expand to other fields in the natural sciences.

   “Publications will be complementary to both traditional research journals and data repositories,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and will be designed to foster data sharing and reuse,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and ultimately to accelerate scientific discovery.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Founded on
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/principles/">
   Six key Principles
  </a>
  , the new Journal offers what the scientific community has been desperately needing for long time:
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/">
   <span class="journalname">
    Scientific Data
   </span>
  </a>
  gives credit through a citable publication,
  <br/>
  for depositing and sharing research data.
  <br/>
  Data Description will be accessible and searchable via
  <br/>
  the
  <span class="journalname">
   Scientific Data
  </span>
  online data platform, under a
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">
   Creative Commons
  </a>
  license.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  The actual data files will be stored in one or more public, community-recognized systems.
  <br/>
  The full release of Data Description and associated data will be verified as part of the peer-review process.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  Where a community recognized repository does not exist,
  <br/>
  <span class="journalname">
   Scientific Data
  </span>
  supports the deposit of the data into a more general repository such as
  <a href="http://datadryad.org/">
   Dryad
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://figshare.com/">
   Figshare
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  All accepted data descriptors will be published on payment of an article-processing charge (APC)
  <br/>
  that will also cover the Data Description curation process.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <p>
   This is a transformational move on the part of the Nature Publishing Group, that truly moves that scientific community towards recovering healthy practices of scientific data gathering and sharing. This new Journal marks a step forward on finally treating the damage that the “
   <em>
    Publish of Perish
   </em>
   ” delusion have made to the core values of the scientific community for many decades.
