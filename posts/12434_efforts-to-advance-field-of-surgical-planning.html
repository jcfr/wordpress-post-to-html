  Printing 3D anatomic models for medical scans is quickly becoming a popular and effective tool for surgical planning. Such patient-specific 3D models are increasing surgeons’ understanding of the critical anatomy involved and the surgical approaches that should be taken for each case. Patient-specific models also enable less invasive procedures to be determined and conducted with confidence.

   3D Slicer
  </a>
  application that is being used by many companies and research teams. Today, the role of the 3D Slicer application in 3D anatomic printing for surgical planning is featured prominently in the healthcare story “
  <a href="http://makezine.com/magazine/hands-on-health-care/">
   Man Saves Wife’s Sight by 3D Printing Her Tumor
  </a>
  .”  The 3D computer-generated displays in that article were generated using 3D Slicer.
