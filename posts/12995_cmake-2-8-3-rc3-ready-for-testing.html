  The CMake 2.8.3 release candidate stream continues! You can find the source and binaries here:

  </a>
  <br/>
  This will be the last release candidate for 2.8.3 unless a major regression is reported. So please try it on your projects and let us know right away about any problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since we switched to git, and a new workflow, we’re expecting to do more frequent releases. Because of that, our release candidate phases will be shorter than they have been historically. So, if you want to test this out and ask for a fix, do it soon, or hold your peace till the next release!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following is the list of changes in this release. Since we switched to git, this list is now the ‘git log’ one line summary written by the named CMake developers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please try this version of CMake on your projects and report any issues to the list or the bug tracker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Happy building!
