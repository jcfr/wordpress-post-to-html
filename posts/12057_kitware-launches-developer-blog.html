  Our team is free to write about whatever topic they’d like (of course, without violating any legal agreements). So what you see on the blog may not necessarily represent the views of Kitware as a whole, and you may even see dissenting opinions in the comments posted by other Kitware employees. Comments have been enabled so that you can interact with the posts as they go live. We encourage our readers to provide suggestions and engage in a dialogue with us and each other through the Kitware blog. While we do allow negative feedback, we will remove any spam, profanity, or excessively inflammatory comments.

  Our hope for the blog is that it helps to put faces to the names you so often see on our mailing lists and in the commit logs, and that our user communities can get to know the development force behind Kitware’s many

  and projects. And maybe in the process we’ll be able to garner some feedback and lend some insight as to how we go about releasing software and developing new technologies.
