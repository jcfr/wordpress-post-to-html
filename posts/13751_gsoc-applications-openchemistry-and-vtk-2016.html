  Last week we submitted
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/" target="_blank">
   Google Summer of Code
  </a>
  organization applications for the
  <a href="http://openchemistry.org/" target="_blank">
   Open Chemistry
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://vtk.org/" target="_blank">
   VTK
  </a>
  projects. VTK has taken part in previous years, and had a number of successful student projects over those years. The Open Chemistry project is a collection of related projects for chemistry, materials science, and related disciplines, with a number of collaborators from around the world.Â Please wish us luck, as both projects would love to host students over the summer.

  This is also a great time to let any students you know about this program, it is a fantastic opportunity for students to get paid to work on an open source project over the summer. I was a student in 2007, and really enjoyed the freedom and the time I was able to dedicate to a project I was passionate about. I have since participated as a mentor and organization administrator in most subsequent years.
