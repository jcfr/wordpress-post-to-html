  As we mentioned briefly in
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/itkv4-the-new-itk/">
   our recent post
  </a>
  , the upcoming version of
  <a href="http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4.0">
   ITKv4
  </a>
  will provide better support for
  <a href="http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/Microscopy">
   Microscopy Applications
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are some of the critical topics for which we will be improving ITKv4 in order to better serve application developers in the domain of Microscopy imaging.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Very Large datasets (GigaBytes / TeraBytes)
  </li>
  <li>
   Temporal data (2D+t, 3D+t)
  </li>
  <li>
   Multiple Components per pixel
  </li>
  <li>
   Very large number of objects of interest per image
  </li>
  <li>
   High throughput (thousands of datasets to analyze in batch/parallel)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Since all of these topics are far from trivial, we need the joint effort of a larger community to address them properly. No single institution has the “know how”, access to domain experts, and technology for effectively tackling these problems on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  A collaboration effort is the best approach for jointly addressing these challenges. To that end we are coordinating with different groups that currently work in microscopy and related biomedical fields to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Gather common resources
  </li>
  <li>
   Identify specific needs and challenges
  </li>
  <li>
   Share effort on addressing problems
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  We anticipate that each one of the participants, and the community at large, will benefit from distributing the burden of working on each one of those individual problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have already identified several critical technologies that must be added to ITK to support microscopy, such as:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   More explicit representation of time and channels
  </li>
  <li>
   Management of multi-resolution datasets
  </li>
  <li>
   Management of multi-gigabyte datasets (TeraBytes being the standard to look for in 5 years)
  </li>
 </ul>
