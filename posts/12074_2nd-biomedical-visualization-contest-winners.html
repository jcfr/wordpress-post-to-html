  <strong>
   Image Description
  </strong>
  : Diffusion Spectrum Imaging data has been processed by the Connectome Mapping Pipeline, bundling white matter tracts and producing networks in multiple resolutions (number of nodes) and different edge attributes. The image was rendered using the ConnectomeViewer application. This network has 258 nodes corresponding to cortical and subcortical ROIs (shown as blue cubes and as transparent surfaces), the edges depict threshold and color-coded densities between connecting ROIs. Green cubes are picked for further processing with the integrated Python interface. See also

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Role of Open Source
  </strong>
  : The ConnectomeViewer application’s framework was built using Enthought Envisage, with Mayavi2 using TVTK as plugin. TVTK wraps
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org">
   VTK
  </a>
  to trait-enable Python. Nifti, Gifti, Connectome File Format (CFF) were also employed.

  <strong>
   Image Description
  </strong>
  : Vascular anomaly and pulmonary sequestration diagnosis using IRCAD software applications on a thoracic CT-scan of a 1 month old baby with direct volume rendering (first line) and surface rendering resulting from organ segmentations (second line) in anterior view (left) and posterior view (right). The resulting preoperative surgical planning allows to reach arteries and the lung area to be cut with an optimal back intercostal tool positioning that is perfectly reproduced intraoperatively (last line).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Role of Open Source
  </strong>
  : Image segmentation is done using
  <a href="http://www.itk.org">
   ITK
  </a>
  (morphological mathematics, topological, geometrical and textural operators) included in IRCAD 3DVPM software.
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org">
   VTK
  </a>
  is used by IRCAD VR-Render software (
  <a href="www.ircad.fr/software">
   www.ircad.fr/software
  </a>
  ) for direct volume rendering (3D texturing with vtkVolumeTextureMapper3D). These software applications work with other Open Source systems like wxWidgets (for GUI), gdcm/dcmtk (for loading DICOM), vtkinria3d, vgSDK or boost.
