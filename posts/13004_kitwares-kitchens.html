  My first tour of Kitware’s Clifton Park facilities last summer began in the downstairs kitchen. I had first been impressed with the Keurig hot beverage machine – a little something that would keep me amused every time I used it up to this day. One machine. A variety of little cups that you could tuck in to suit different tastes. That’s kind of how the Insight and Visualization Toolkits work – filtering images and data the way the machine filtered water. Both gave you something different, depending on what you filtered it through. I hadn’t been able to make the connection then, of course, but by the end of my first summer, those machines had given me another reason for amusement.
