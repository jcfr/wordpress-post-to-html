    On behalf of the ITK community, Kitware and the ITK team are happy to announce the release of the
    <a href="http://itk.org/">
     Insight Toolkit
    </a>
    4.1.0! This release is the first since ITK 4.0.0 and includes a number of improvements and new features. Additionally, this is the first release to deviate from the even-only minor release number, an effect of transitioning to Git.

    Notable improvements in this release include better VTK Bridge and WrapITK support, a new deconvolution filtering module with several classes, and a new TimeVaryingBSplineVelocityFieldTransform. There are also enhancements to the Registrationv4 and LevelSetsv4 frameworks, and a new video filtering module that includes a method to use standard filters in a video pipeline. Additionally, InsightApplications (from the ITKApps repository) has also seen a number of updates to ITKv4.
