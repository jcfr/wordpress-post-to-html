  Kitware Inc. and Mitsubishi are teaming together to provide a new standard in high performance volume rendering. In 1999 Mitsubish will be releasing their new VolumePRO volume rendering hardware. (see 3D Volume Graphics, the next frontier of advanced graphics.) Kitware will be providing full support for this hardware in VTK as well as providing demonstration code and applications. Historically volume rendering has been too slow for practical use on “real world” data such as a medical CT scan. By combining VTK with the VolumePRO board researchers and doctors will be capable of interactive three-dimensional investigations previously out of reach due to performace limitations or the cost of purchasing a supercomputer.
