   In late October Kitware will launch the new ParaView (paraview.org) and CDash (cdash.org) websites.
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
   </span>
   The new CMake (cmake.org) site went live at the beginning of September.
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
   </span>
   Additionally, a brand new site for the new VTKEdge toolkit (vtkedge.org) will go live in late October as well.
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
   </span>
   The new site design is focused on providing researchers and developers with streamlined access to information and will provide users with a multitude of resources to assist in development, creating easier access to licensing information, related publications, ways to get involved with the projects, and resources for development and support.
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
   </span>
   Additionally, the new sites are uniformly designed so that users will find consistency when accessing information from project to project.
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
   </span>
   We are expecting to release new sites for VTK (vtk.org) and ITK (itk.org) by the end of this year.
