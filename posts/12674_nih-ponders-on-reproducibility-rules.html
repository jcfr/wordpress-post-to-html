  After having hosted
  <a href="http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/bsa/bsa0313/Varmus.pdf">
   two workshops
  </a>
  on the issues reproducibility in 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are just beginning to take active measures to restore the proper practice of scientific research.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://irp.nih.gov/pi/lawrence-tabak">
   Lawrence Tabak
  </a>
  , the agency’s principal deputy director, stated
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   “There is certainly sufficient information now that the NIH
   <br/>
   feels it’s appropriate to look at this at a central-agency level,”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wadman reports that
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <em>
   This summer, Tabak and other senior NIH officials, including Story Landis, director at the neurology institute, and Harold Varmus, director at the cancer institute, are assessing input gathered from the directors of the agency’s 27 institutes and centres. They will then confer with NIH director Francis Collins, who will decide what steps to take.

 <p>
  This is on the context of recent findings, that

   Wadman captures in the following list

   <strong>

   A survey at the MD Anderson Cancer Center finds that

  Tabak suggested:
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   “If the premise isn’t validatable,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   then we’re done;
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   it doesn’t matter how well you wrote the grant,”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Wadman states also that:
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   Agency officials are also considering a requirement
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   that independent labs validate the results of important
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   preclinical studies as a condition of receiving grant funding.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  There is of course, the question of who will pay for reproducibility and how much would that be. This is what makes so significant that finally the conversation has escalated to the level of the largest US Federal funding agency.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has been estimated that the cost of a reproducibility study will be in the range of $25,000. This is about 5% of the original cost of doing the research, and when put in context, it is a small cost to pay for ensuring that the initial social investment in scientific research truly leads to results that stand to inspection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scientific reproducibility is therefore emerging as a Market Service, whose customers are any of the R&amp;D organizations that take as input the results of basic research funded by public agencies.
 </p>

  The pioneer in this field is

 <p>
  Other key players in the space of
  <strong>
   Reproducible Research
  </strong>
  are
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.runmycode.org/CompanionSite/">
    Run My Code
   </a>
   : a site that allows researchers to replicate scientific results in order to check their validity and robustness.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://figshare.com/">
    Figshare
   </a>
   : a place where data, negative results and true verification materials are shared publicly.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.plosone.org/">
    PLoS ONE
   </a>
   : the progressive mega-journal that is require software-intensive papers to include source code under open source licenses.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">
    Mendeley
   </a>
   : The platform for managing and sharing research papers.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These progressive organizations are taking upon themselves to restore the honest practice of the scientific method, that is anchored on the practice of reproducibility verification.
