  Kitware is very pleased to annouce the recognition of Dr. Ken Martin, Chairman and CFO of Kitware, as CFO of the Year by the Albany Business Review. Dr. Martin was selected as a finalist last month from among over 100 nominations in the small business category, and was named the category winner at an awards ceremony in Troy, New York.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  During the awards ceremony, the Business Review noted Dr. Martin’s unique background in physics, computer science, and electrical and computer systems. It is with this technical background that he co-founded Kitware along with four other developers in 1998. As the company grew from the original founders to over 100 employees, the need for financial management and planning increased. Rather than outsource this critical need, Ken self-educated himself in this area and transitioned from the role of a technical developer to chief financial officer.

  As CFO, Dr. Martin is responsible for the overall financial management of the company, its financial reporting and transparency, and for multiple corporate functions including contracting, compliance audit, legal, and long-range planning. Ken has monitored and steered the growth of Kitware carefully without incurring debt or taking outside investments through careful management of the company’s assets and planning for future revenue and expenditures. It’s through these strategies that the company has been able to be profitable since its first year, and grow on the order of 25% per year for more than a decade.

  In addition to leading the financial and compliance efforts for Kitware, Dr. Martin remains an active software developer. He is one of the lead architects and core developers of CMake, Kitware’s open-source software build system, as well as the company’s internal integrated software for managing proposals, contracts, time keeping, and resource allocations.
