  The CMake 2.8.6 release candidate stream continues! You can find the source and binaries here:
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to test this out and ask for a fix, do it soon, or hold your peace till the next release! I expect we will finalize the 2.8.6 release by mid-September.
 </p>
 <p>
  This release candidate we do not have pre-built binaries for the SunOS anymore. As mentioned on the CMake mailing list recently, our Sun hardware has bitten the proverbial dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, we are now providing two sets of installers for the Mac. The “Darwin” versions are for Mac OSX 10.4 and later, and are “ppc;i386” universal binaries. The “Darwin64” versions are for 10.6 and later, and are “x86_64;i386” universal binaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following is the list of changes in this release. Since we switched to git, this list is now the ‘git log’ one line summary written by the named CMake developers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please try this version of CMake on your projects and report any issues to the list or the bug tracker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Happy building!
