   3D Slicer
  </a>
  is a free, open source, extensible application for visualization and image analysis. It is widely used in the field of medical computing, with over 425,000 downloads. In the field, 3D Slicer is applied to research and applications that range from preclinical animal studies to surgical planning, to surgical guidance, to medical robot control, to 3D printing, to population studies.
 </p>
 <p>
  3D Slicer is made possible through
  <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Release/Acknowledgments">
   contributions from an international community
  </a>
  of scientists from a multitude of fields, including engineering and biomedicine. The authors of this blog are the Kitware team which participated in the wider community that made this release happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  On behalf of the 3D Slicer development community, we are pleased to announce that version 4.10 is
  <a href="http://download.slicer.org">
   now available for download
  </a>
  . This version introduces close to 500 feature enhancements and bug fixes for better performance and stability. It includes more than 20 new-and-improved core modules and more than 25 new-and-improved extensions.

  Here are some release highlights:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A new rendering infrastructure can more quickly rendering complex models. In addition, GPU-accelerated volume rendering works on many more hardware configurations than before. It is also faster and higher quality. The minimum required OpenGL version is now 3.2.
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">
      Threaded Building Blocks (TBB)
     </a>
     is now available as a SMP backend in VTK. It is enabled by default on Windows. Multi-threaded image filter execution is typically improved by 20-30%.

  <li>
   New Segmentation effects and features include the following:

      Save segmentations directly to STL or OBJ files
     </a>
     .
    </li>
    <li>
     Set different resolutions for the segmentation internal labelmap and the master volume. The labelmap can be set to a higher resolution, isotropic, etc. To do so, click the box icon next to the master volume selector.
    </li>
    <li>
     Automatically detect if slice views are not aligned to internal labelmap volume’s axes and allow alignment by clicking the warning icon that appears next to the segmentation node selector.
    </li>

     </a>
     .
    </li>
    <li>
     Apply tube segmentation for needle trajectories or other tubular objects (in the SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension).
    </li>
   </ul>
