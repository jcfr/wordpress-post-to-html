     Kitware and UNC-Chapel Hill Receive NIH Award to Predict Stroke Outcomes
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. For some stroke patients, standard therapy can lead to swift and complete recovery. For others, the same treatment can be ineffective and may even lead to further brain hemorrhage. Recent clinical research suggests that the presence of subtle brain blood vessels, known as leptomeningeal collaterals, may be a strong predictor of the effectiveness of traditional thrombolytic therapy for treating acute stroke patients; however, existing methods for detecting those vessels involve digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which is an invasive and risky procedure that requires guiding a catheter from the groin along blood vessels through the body to reach and image the vessels in the brain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) have teamed up to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system that automates collateral vessel status assessment using non-invasive and low-risk computed tomography angiography (CTA). To accelerate the pace of their collaboration, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded Kitware $150,000 to develop and test a prototype of Kitware’s system. The project is jointly led by Dr. Stephen Aylward, Director of Operations – North Carolina at Kitware, and Dr. Yueh Lee, a leading neuroradiologist and researcher at UNC-Chapel Hill Department of Radiology.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This work brings together a strong yet diverse team to integrate clinical imaging with advanced image analysis algorithms and deliver a solution that can bridge research and clinical practice,” Aylward said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project will build on a decade of collaborative vascular modeling research at Kitware and UNC-Chapel Hill. Upon completing the effort, the team aims to present the computer-aided diagnosis system as a foundation for precision medicine research in acute stroke patients. This research can help physicians create personalized, targeted treatments by identifying subtle yet important differences between patients.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In addition to driving acute stroke research, the project will open the door for numerous pre-clinical and clinical investigations and applications for other neurovascular conditions such as sickle cell disease, moyamoya disease, aneurysms, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, concussions, and neurodegeneration,” Aylward said.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of the effort, Kitware will release algorithms for vessel modeling and analysis as open-source software. This software builds on the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) and the 3D Slicer application for medical data visualization. Both ITK and 3D Slicer are freely available, open-source software that are developed and supported by Kitware and used in medical image analysis research and commercial products throughout the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to participating in collaborative research, Kitware offers consulting services to groups that seek to build commercial systems using ITK, 3D Slicer, and Kitware’s expertise in vessel quantification and other medical technologies.

     NIH Awards $1.26 Million to Kitware and Collaborators for Cancer Research
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  In cancer drug research, existing imaging technologies used to assess treatment response are expensive, time consuming, and difficult to operate. To overcome these challenges, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded a $1.26 million small-business research project, led by Kitware, to develop a low-cost and widely applicable system for assessing cancer treatment efficacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The research project is centered on a novel approach to cancer detection and diagnosis that is based on using acoustic angiography to measure small changes in the microvessels that feed tumors. Acoustic angiography is a contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging technique that is being developed by Dr. Paul Dayton at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), who is a principal investigator on the project. The technique can provide unprecedented clarity in visualizing microvascular abnormalities associated with malignant cancers that resolve when those cancers respond to treatment. Although acoustic angiography is promising, manually measuring the microvessel changes that it reveals can be time consuming and prone to error.  For the research project, acoustic angiography is combined with automated vessel modeling and computer-aided diagnosis methods developed at Kitware to provide a low-cost, fast, and accurate cancer treatment monitoring system.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The characterization of microvascular features for the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer has shown great promise, but the application of this technique has traditionally involved costly imaging equipment and highly constrained conditions,” Dr. Stephen Aylward, a principal investigator on the project and Director of Operations – North Carolina at Kitware, said. “Combining computer-aided diagnosis of microvasculature with acoustic angiography creates a powerful and practical diagnostic tool for preclinical and clinical cancer research.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During Phase I of the project, Kitware and the Dayton Lab at UNC confirmed that the novel ultrasound-based approach can distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors and track vascular changes throughout disease development. The team also optimized the methods for modeling and analyzing vessels so that they run in minutes, rather than hours, and offer significantly improved accuracy.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Phase II, the team will partner with SonoVol to integrate the proposed approach into a commercial ultrasound imaging system for preclinical research. The system will provide cancer researchers with an innovative tool for studying animal models of malignancies in nearly any organ in the body. It will enable rapid alignment of images taken over time for observing longitudinal vascular remodeling and present substantial benefits over existing technologies. For example, the system will cost less than half of what traditional systems cost; it will be suitable for users who do not have expertise in imaging physics; and it will be benchtop, user agnostic, and noninvasive.
 </p>
 <p>
  “An equivalently fast, accurate, noninvasive, low-cost, and quantitative tumor micro-environment imaging instrument does not exist,” Aylward said. “As a result, most researchers have to reserve time and expert support on shared instruments at facilities that charge extremely high fees. The proposed system will provide affordable and easy-to-use technology that could accelerate the pace of cancer research, bringing life-saving therapeutics to the patient’s bedside sooner and with a lower development cost.”
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of the Phase II effort, Kitware will release algorithms for vessel modeling and analysis as open-source software, building on the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) and the 3D Slicer application for medical data visualization. Both ITK and 3D Slicer are freely available. They are developed and supported by Kitware and are used in medical image analysis research and commercial products throughout the world.
