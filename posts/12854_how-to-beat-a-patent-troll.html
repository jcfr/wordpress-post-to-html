  It is well known that litigation costs the Technology Sector about
  <br/>
  <a href="http://researchoninnovation.org/dopatentswork/">
   four times what the technology sector makes on licensing patents
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  In short, a patent system that is disfunctional for the technology sector
  <br/>
  becomes a tax on entrepreneurs whose only beneficiaries are the litigant
  <br/>
  patent attorneys and the patent trolls.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is particularly acute in the arena of Software and Business
  <br/>
  Methods Patents, both of which were never authorized by Congress,
  <br/>
  but whose proliferation has been possible due to a
  <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/press/Books/2005/mathyoucantuse.aspx">
   set of rulings
  </a>
  by
  <br/>
  the
  <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">
   Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit
  </a>
  (CAFC).
 </p>
 <p>
  The National Academy of Sciences has called for a restructuring
  <br/>
  of the Patent System, and in particular, made recommendations
  <br/>
  on
  <a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony/Patent_System_Overhaul.asp">
   how to repair the CAFC
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr. Curtis clarifies:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…the problem with these patents
   <br/>
   is that they are obscure
   <br/>
   and the
   <a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony/Patent_System_Overhaul.asp">
    Patent System is Disfunctional
   </a>
   ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   as a result most of these patents end up in settlements
   <br/>
   and because the settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement
   <br/>
   no one knows what the terms were
   <br/>
   and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case”.
   <br/>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Patent Trolls are non-practicing entities. That is, they don’t build anything
  <br/>
  and they don’t commercialize any products. Instead, they acquire patents from
  <br/>
  patent holders, and turn around and file lawsuits against companies that will
  <br/>
  prefer to settle for hefty payments, rather than go through the long and
  <br/>
  expensive process of going to court.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…one of the major problems with patent law
   <br/>
   is that when you are sued for patent infringement
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   the burden of proof that you don’t infringe on the patent
   <br/>
   is on the defendant…  and this can take quite a while…”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  In his talk, Drew Curtis, describes that the typical defense of a patent
  <br/>
  lawsuit will cost $2 million, and it will take 18 months… when you win.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is fascinating about Drew Curtis’ talk is that as a good entrepreneur,
  <br/>
  he took the time to understand the
  <a href="http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2012/02/articles/attorney/patent-infringement/the-patent-toll-lawyer-business-model/">
   Business Model of the Patent Troll
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  and knowing its weaknesses, he maneuvered them into a losing position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is the
  <strong>
   key of his strategy
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Make clear from the beginning you do not have any money,
   <br/>
   or that you would rather spend money with your attorney
   <br/>
   fighting the patent troll,
   <br/>
   rather than giving them the money…
   <br/>
   The reason this work is because
   <br/>
   Patent Trolls
   <strong>
    are paid a
   </strong>
   <strong>
    percentage
   </strong>
   of whatever
   <br/>
   they are able to recover in the
   <strong>
    settlements
   </strong>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “If it becomes clear to them that they can not recover any money,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   they become less interested in pursuing the case”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, and here is the legal
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu">
   Jujutsu
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Make sure to tell them that you will make this process as
   <br/>
   annoying, and as painful, and as difficult as possible for them.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   This is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   to get their way. It turns out that because they are paid on
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   contingency, it works really, really well in reverse.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr. Curtis says it comes down to one thing:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Don’t negotiate with terrorists !”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  To make emphasis on the economic cost,
  <br/>
  Curtis points out:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Patent trolls have made more damage to the US economy,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   than any war or terrorist organization in history,
  </em>
  <em>
   every year”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is an estimated $500 Billion.
 </p>
 <p>
  To put this cost in perspective, this is
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Twice as much as the revenue of the
   <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/the-software-manufacturing-delusion/">
    entire software for sale industry
   </a>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   More than
   <a href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/presentations/aaasrd20100111.pdf">
    three times the entire US Federal Research Budget
   </a>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   More than 70% of the
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States#Budget_for_2010">
    US Defense Budget
   </a>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Ending on a humorous note, Curtis points out that he had
  <br/>
  a clever idea and that he would like to be awarded a patent
  <br/>
  on his invention:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “The business model of filing patent lawsuits on mobile computing”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr. Curtis promises that if the U.S. Patent Office
  <br/>
  awards him this patent, he will
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Sue the Patent Trolls out of existence !”
  </em>
