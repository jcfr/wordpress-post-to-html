  Starting with ParaView 3.98, we introduced a unified
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/effectively-using-the-properties-panel-in-paraview/">
   <em>
    Properties
   </em>
  </a>
  panel —  a single panel that shows both the source properties as well as display properties. This replaced an UI design that existed in ParaView since early days where source and display properties were shown in separate panels. While the goal of this change was to avoid having the users to switch between tabs when setting up visualizations, a few users and ParaView customizers expressed their fondness for the old style. With addition of the
  <em>
   <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/paraviews-view-settings-is-moving-to-the-properties-panel/">
    View
   </a>
  </em>
  properties to the
  <em>
   Properties
  </em>
  panel, it is totally understandable if some users simply prefer separate panels rather than a single long panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  With changes slated for the next release, you will now be able to select whether ParaView uses a single, unified
  <em>
   Properties
  </em>
  panel or separate panels for
  <em>
   Display
  </em>
  properties, or
  <em>
   View
  </em>
  properties, or both. The option is provided as an application setting, available under the
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/new-in-paraview-settings-ui/">
   <em>
    Settings
   </em>
  </a>
  dialog.

    Setting to customize the

    panel
   </b>
  </center>
  Default is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Combined Properties panel
   </em>
  </strong>
  , indicating all properties are shown in a single panel. If you want to have only the
  <i>
   Display
  </i>
  properties in a separate panel, select
  <strong>
   <em>
    Display Properties in a separate panel
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Choose
  <strong>
   <em>
    View Properties in a separate panel
   </em>
  </strong>
  to show only the
  <em>
   View
  </em>
  properties in a separate dock panel, while keeping the
  <em>
   Source
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Display
  </em>
  properties in the same
  <em>
   Properties
  </em>
  panel. The last option will create separate dock panels for all the three types of properties. Note that you will have to restart ParaView for the setting to take effect.
