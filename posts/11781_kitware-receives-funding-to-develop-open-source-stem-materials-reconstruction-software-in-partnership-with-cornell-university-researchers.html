   Application will help scientific community meet growing demand for improved S/TEM microscopy software for visualization and analysis of nanoscale materials.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware has announced Phase II funding from the Department of Energy  (DoE) to continue development of an open-source platform for materials  reconstruction using scanning transmission electron microscopes (S/TEM),  in partnership with researchers at Cornell University.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project is a response to shortcomings in current state-of-the-art  tomography software processes that involve long analysis cycle times  and the use of several different file formats, which makes it difficult  to document and publish analysis and reconstruction results in a manner  that is accessible to the broader scientific community. Motivated to  provide a solution, Kitware is collaborating with Cornell University to  build

   tomviz,
  </a>
  a fully-functional, freely-distributable S/TEM platform that provides  advanced segmentation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, and  analysis optimized for materials applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There are approximately 600 transmission electron microscopes in the  world today, and close to 50 new microscopes are made available online  each year, creating a high demand for an open-source tomography  platform,” Dr. Robert Hovden, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell  University and key collaborator on the project, said.

   Phase I,
  </a>
  the team produced a cross-platform application that reads transmission  electron microscope image data, implements graphical tools for  user-assisted data alignment, performs basic tomographic reconstruction,  and visualizes the resulting 3D volume. The application has already  been well-received, with hundreds of downloads from the scientific  community.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The application presents users with advanced, intuitive software and  workflows that enable the full path of data from collection to final,  analyzed results to be saved, shared, and even published as supporting  information,”

   Dr. Marcus D. Hanwell,

  the Principal Investigator for the project and a Technical Leader at Kitware, said.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Phase II, the team will develop an extendable, turn-key platform  that is capable of fully-automated, high-throughput electron tomography  of nanoscale materials. The platform will feature a modern user  interface and enhanced graphical tools for editing, aligning,  segmenting, visualizing, and analyzing data. It will also feature  one-click tomography, making it possible to easily reconstruct  experimental data and visualize it in 3D.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As a result of the project, it will be possible to have the entire  tomography process, from measurement to 3D analysis, take place on a  single graphical platform,” Hanwell said. “This technology will greatly  accelerate progress in materials characterization and metrology, while  also promoting reproducible science.”
