     IS&amp;T/SPIE Electronic Imaging Conference
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  The IS&amp;T/SPIE Electronic Imaging conference was held in San Francisco from January 23–27 this year.  This conference is the must-attend event for all aspects of electronic imaging, including imaging systems, image processing, image quality, and algorithms.  It featured multiple, parallel tracks on 3D Imaging, Interaction and Measurement; Imaging, Visualization, and Perception; Image Processing; Digital Imaging Sensors and Applications; Multimedia Processing and Applications; and Visual Information Processing and Communication.  This year Kitware joined forces with Portola Pharmaceuticals to present a poster and live demonstration on “Tracking flow of leukocytes in blood for drug analysis,” (authors A. Basharat, W. D. Turner, G. Stephens, B. Badillo, R. Lumpkin, P. Andre, and A. Perera).  The work was presented by Arslan Basharat and Wesley Turner of Kitware.

     Kitware Awarded NASA Grant
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  It was announced in March that NASA awarded SBIR funding to Kitware to further develop ParaView to meet the needs of ultrascale visualization. The software will address critical issues in order to enable real-time investigation of extremely large datasets using massive distributed memory architectures with up to 100,000 cores.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will be collaborating with California-based SciberQuest, leaders in kinetic modeling of space plasmas, to complete the project. This partnership enables us to work with real world data from petascale simulations directly relevant to NASA’s missions and scientific goals, and allows the development to be guided by the ultimate users of the software.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this investigative phase we will identify scaling bottlenecks in ParaView, which is currently used by NASA to explore the results of trillion element particle simulations on the Pleiades supercomputer. As the number of processors scales up past ten thousand, we anticipate that the most critical issues will be data IO, architectural overhead, and the compositing of the partial results. While the Phase I effort of this project is limited to developing prototypes and only select improvements will be incorporated into the software, if the Phase II effort is funded the complete range of improvements will be merged into ParaView and the underlying Visualization Toolkit (VTK), which will benefit tens of thousands of researchers world-wide.

     NA-MIC Project Week
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  The NA-MIC community met for their 7th annual All Hands Meeting and External Advisory Board meeting January 7-10 in Salt Lake City, Utah. With the recent renewal of the NIH National Center of Biomedical Computing NA-MIC grant, this AHM/EAB meeting marked the beginning of the next four years of what will ultimately be a 10-year project.  Well over 100 people were in attendance, including science officers and other NIH officials.  One common theme to this meeting was the impact Slicer was having throughtout the world. That impact is well illustrated by the figure below – it shows the locations to which Slicer has been downloaded.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">

 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware was present in force and made significant contributions to the meeting and Slicer. Stephen Aylward, Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin, Julien Finet, Tina Kapur, Danielle Pace, Dave Partyka, Zach Mullen and Will Schroeder were in attendance. Some of the areas where Kitware was focusing its efforts included the preview release of Slicer 4 (a Qt-based rewrite of Slicer spearheaded by Julien Finet and Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin); the beta release of TubeTK (an adjunct toolkit that provides sliding-organ registration and vascular analysis capabilities, by Danielle and Stephen); a 64-bit Slicer Windows build by Dave Partyka and Steve Pieper; DICOM/MIDAS data integration by Zach Mullen; and two new reformat widgets being developed by Will Schroeder.   We are looking forward to four more full and rewarding years with NA-MIC, and many more years with Slicer beyond those.

     VTK Selected for Google Summer of Code
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) has been accepted for the 2011 Google Summer of Code, with Kitware acting as the mentoring organization. This program encourages student participation in open source communities through three-month paid development projects. Students interested in the program apply to work on a specific project and work with a mentor at the organization over the course of the summer. This global program gives students the opportunity to work on real-world software projects and provides mentoring organizations with potential new developers. Additionally, since all development is open source, the projects grow and code is contributed back to the community.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of 417 applications this year, Google selected 175 open source projects for participation, 50 of which are new to the program. Google has posted a list of all accepted projects.  Kitware has several project ideas for students, such as the development of new 2D charts, chemistry visualization, volume rendering in WebGL, AMR volume rendering and Apple iOS support for ParaViewWeb.

     Tibbetts Award
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Kitware received a Tibbetts Award for its Software Toolkit for Image-Guided Surgery (IGSTK) Phase I and II STTRS. The award, which recognizes companies who represent excellence in achieving the mission and goals of the SBIR and STTR programs, is named for Roland Tibbetts. Tibbetts is considered the father of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which he began as an experimental project at the National Science Foundation in the early 1980’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  IGSTK, our tool for research involving minimally invasive image-guided medical procedures, is being used in investigations into new surgical techniques that may improve surgical accuracy and precision, increase a surgeon’s ability to confidently treat challenging and complex pathologies, decrease surgical trauma, and reduce recovery time for patients.
 </p>
 <p>
  The IGSTK STTR is a collaborative research project between Kitware’s New York and North Carolina offices and the Computer Aided Interventional and Medical Robotics (CAIMR) group, which is led by Dr. Kevin Cleary at Georgetown University.

      Kitware Celebrates its Anniversary
     </strong>
    </span>
   </span>
   <br/>
  </span>
  This March Kitware celebrated its 13th anniversary. The company has grown significantly since 1998, from five co-founders to nearly 100 employees, with offices in three cities on two continents. There are several factors that I believe have enabled our success, which I would like to share.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, at Kitware we have always been fortunate in that we have an attitude of service, doing what each of us does best and helping each other. We have been able to take the best in each of us to create something better than any one of us could do on our own. We also had great early customers to fuel our growth, including Terry Yoo at the National Library of Medicine who established the ITK project in 1999, Jim Ahrens at Los Alamos who pushed for parallelizing VTK for use on supercomputers and who started the ParaView project, Brian Wylie at Sandia who supported and promoted ParaView, and a collection of customers ranging from oil and gas to computing hardware manufacturers to research collaborators in academia and various research labs. I also think we are riding a profound wave of innovation and collaboration due to the emerging open source movement, and have been able to ride this wave to create technically excellent products and very effective collaborations. At Kitware, we have also created a synergistic and powerful technology portfolio that enables us to create solutions for customers that few other companies can deliver. Finally, we have developed outstanding business processes that provide a foundation of stability in what is a very dynamic business environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, while all of these are unquestionably vital to our past and future success, there is one element of our success that I have come to fully understand, and that is the caliber of our people, which I would like to explain by way of a discussion of workplace diversity. I am sure that many of you have heard business leaders talking about the importance of diversity in the workplace. Early on I thought “diversity” simply referred to the mix of genders, ages, cultural backgrounds and so on that creates a stimulating work environment. While these factors are certainly important, they are only the tip of the diversity iceberg: what makes this company great is the tremendous range of skills, abilities, talents and potential that we collectively represent.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the coming years we will continue the practices that have enabled our success: service to our co-workers and collaborators; finding supportive customers; growing our leading-edge technology portfolio; extending our open source outreach; and refining our business processes. Moreover we will continue to hire some of the best talent we can find, and we will do all we can to unleash the diverse potential of the people at Kitware.
