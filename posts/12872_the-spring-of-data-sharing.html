  The cold Winter tradition of clinging to data and restricting access to information is now melting down and giving way to a warm Spring of information sharing.

  Here are some of the promising events with which we have started the Spring of 2012:

  It has finally clicked that information is not useful when it is accumulated into piles, but rather when it is flowing, much like an electric charge is of no use unless it is flowing and becomes electric current. It follows that any resistance to the flow of information results in heat dissipation, loss of power, and economic waste.
 </p>
 <p>
  People are also starting to realize that a large portion of research and development in the U.S. is funded by taxpayers. The
  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS" title="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS">
   U.S. invests 2.8% of GDP in R&amp;D
  </a>
  , which is about
  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/country/united-states" title="http://data.worldbank.org/country/united-states">
   $420 billion a year
  </a>
  , out of which
  <a href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/fy2013/total13pPIE.pdf" title="http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/fy2013/total13pPIE.pdf">
   $142 billion is provided by the U.S. Federal R&amp;D budget
  </a>
  , hence, provided by taxpayers. In this context, there is no economic logic in restricting the flow of the resulting information (technical and scientific papers), just for the convenience of a $2 billion-per-year market of the scientific publishers.

  <em>
   Open Research Computation
  </em>
  publishes peer reviewed articles that describe the development, capacities, and uses of software designed for use by researchers. Submissions relating to software for use in any area of research are welcome as are articles dealing with algorithms, useful code snippets, and large applications, web services, and libraries.
  <em>
   Open Research Computation
  </em>
  differs from other journals with a software focus in its requirement for the software source code to be made available under an Open Source Initiative compliant license, and in its assessment of the quality of documentation and testing of the software. In addition to articles describing software,
  <em>
   Open Research Computation
  </em>
  also welcomes submissions that review or describe developments relating to software based tools for research. These include, but are not limited to, reviews or proposals for standards, discussion of best practice in research software development, educational and support resources and tools for researchers that develop or use software based tools.

  <em>
   PLoS ONE
  </em>
  supports the development of open-source software and believes that for submissions in which software is the central part of the paper, then adherence to appropriate open source standards will ensure that the submission  conforms to their requirements. These requirements state that “methods must be described in sufficient detail so that another researcher is able to reproduce the experiments described” as well as their “aim to promote openness in research and intention that all work published in
  <em>
   PLoS ONE
  </em>
  can be built on by future researchers.” Therefore, if new software or a new algorithm is central to a paper, authors must confirm that the software conforms to the definition of open source as defined by
  <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">
   the ten rules of the Open Source Initiative
  </a>
  . A condition of acceptance is that the software can be run by reviewers accessing the public software and that results presented in the paper are reproducible. The software need only run on one hardware/software platform in common use by the readership (including Matlab), although it must run without dependencies on proprietary or otherwise unobtainable ancillary software. Articles describing software that requires access to databases and other resources whose persistence is not guaranteed (e.g., individual laboratory databases without funding support) will not be considered.
