  </a>
  <br/>
  In this regard, Midas is perfect for supporting this year’s IEEE SciVis contest, which targets the field of computational material science, particularly atomic configurations. The goal of this year’s contest, part of IEEE VisWeek 2012, is to devise a visualization that allows for exploring the phase transitions of a particular ferroelectric material while decreasing the temperature gradually.
 </p>
 <p>
  A repository with this and previous years’ contest data is available in easily-navigable communities. Further contest details and the public data for the contest are available at http://midas3.kitware.com/midas/community/1#tabs-info.

    InnerOptic and Kitware Collaboration
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  InnerOptic Technology and Kitware announced NIH Phase II SBIR funding for the development of a needle guidance system for hepatic tumor ablation. The operating room ready system will provide novel 3D visualizations for needle guidance in soft tissues. Brian Heaney is the PI and will lead and oversee the project at InnerOptic, and Stephen Aylward will lead the Kitware effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using InnerOptic’s Spotlight™ technology, which was developed during Phase I of this grant, intra-operative ultrasound images will be fused with pre-operative computed tomography (CT) images. The Spotlight system renders opaquely and in sharp detail only the portions of the CT data that are in the vicinity of the ultrasound probe or the needle trajectory. This is analogous to a spotlight on stage: illuminating the scene of interest, while the rest of the stage is transparent and out-of-focus to be less distracting.
 </p>
 <p>
  During liver lesion ablations and other image-guided procedures, surgeons and interventional radiologists currently must rely on mentally-integrated information from several imaging modalities. While CT imaging has excellent diagnostic value, breathing and surgical manipulation can cause tissues to move and deform. Additionally, intra-operative ultrasound images are available in real-time but have a limited field-of-view and can be less effective than CT at distinguishing tissues and pathologies. Physicians must therefore alternate between viewing annotated pre-operative CT images or live ultrasound images on separate monitors, with no interaction between them. The awarded Phase II grant will extend Spotlight with registration algorithms that will keep the CT and ultrasound images continuously aligned. The work will result in a radically improved workflow for using CT and ultrasound images in image-guided soft tissue procedures.

     Kitware Wins Three DOE SBIR Awards
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  In April, Kitware announced $450,000 in Department of Energy SBIR Phase I awards. The awards will fund three projects focused on scientific computing: “In-Situ Analysis of Cosmology Data,” “Cloud Computing and Visualization Tools for KBase,” and “Graphical HPC Application Suite for Supporting the Product Simulation Lifecycle.”

   In-Situ Analysis of Cosmology Data
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Dr. Berk Geveci will lead the development of a cosmology analysis framework for in-situ analysis and data-reduction of cosmological simulations. Such simulations play an important role in the DOE’s High Energy Physics Cosmic Frontier program and are critical for understanding dark energy. This project requires an evolutionary shift in the way cosmological predictions are obtained, and therefore addresses critical challenges such as workflow I/O and the lack of domain-specific data analysis algorithms. An infrastructure will be developed that provides data reduction for minimizing input and output, robust and efficient halo-extraction methods, online tracking of halos to capture halo formation dynamics, and in-situ and co-visualization capabilities.

  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to its use in cosmology simulations, the developed framework will have wide applicability in industries that use particle-based simulation techniques, including astrophysics, ballistics and defense, volcanology, oceanology, solid mechanics modeling, and a range of maritime applications. The adaptability of this framework for use with large-data simulations will drive new levels of innovation in the computational sciences and facilitate the necessary transition from terascale work to peta- and exascale computing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Cloud Computing and Visualization Tools for KBase
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Dr. Jeffrey Baumes will lead the work focused on the DOE’s Systems Biology Knowledgebase (Kbase), a community-driven cyberinfrastructure for sharing and integrating biology and genetics data. Kitware will collaborate with The Ohio State University on this project, which will specifically address the critical need of extracting meaningful knowledge from ever-growing volumes of scientific data by making improvements to Kbase. Three distinct improvements will be made to Kbase: the design and incorporation of a new cloud-based architecture for genetics algorithms, integration of new visualization tools, and the ability to link algorithms to existing databases.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fully functional, visualization-enabled Kbase system could be adopted by genetics and systems biology laboratories at academic, government, and industrial research centers due to its customizable, open-source nature. Organizations can use the system to deploy their own components and efficiently produce, share, and run their algorithms from the cloud, providing easy collaboration with researchers from both within and outside of the agency.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Graphical HPC Application Suite for Supporting the Product Simulation Lifecycle
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Bob O’Bara will lead the HPC application suite project, which will focus on enabling widespread adoption of high performance computing (HPC) functionality for small and medium-sized manufacturing firms by providing a suite of open-source applications that address the complete simulation lifecycle. The project will address current hurdles of technology integration, interaction, and scalability. Many of the current tools used to address parts of the simulation lifecycle are rigid, expensive, and cumbersome for non-simulation experts; Kitware’s open-source solution will make it more realistic for organizations of all sizes and budgets to leverage HPC resources.

  The project will address these issues and streamline manufacturing workflows by developing a suite of open-source applications based on a flexible framework and built upon existing open-source HPC toolkits such as CGM, OpenCASCADE, MOAB, Meshkit, and ParaView. This project will specifically target the field of computational fluid dynamics; however, the applications are interchangeable, customizable, and can be easily modified to address various vertical markets. A consistent, intuitive graphical user interface will be used in the different applications in the suite, making it easy to use by experts and non-experts alike.

    Kitware Collaborates on SDAV Institute
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Kitware is a collaborating team member in the Scalable Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization (SDAV) Institute, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program. The project, led by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, is a collaboration between prominent government laboratory, university, and industry partners for the purpose of creating a comprehensive set of tools and techniques that are essential for knowledge discovery on the DOE’s various computing platforms over the next five years.
 </p>
 <p>
  The SDAV Institute’s primary goals are to actively work with application teams and assist them in achieving breakthrough science; and to provide technical solutions in data management, analysis, and visualization, all of which are broadly used by the computational science community. Such expertise is required to address the ever-increasing size, scale, complexity, and richness of scientific data.
 </p>
 <p>
  Current users of DOE computing systems are faced with managing and analyzing their datasets for knowledge discovery, and must often rely on antiquated tools more appropriate for the teraflop era. While new techniques for interpreting large data have been developed, many in the field believe that these new algorithms and implementations will not work on their systems as we move into the many-core era. Without addressing these issues and beliefs, there will be a widening gap between computational and I/O capacity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The SDAV Institute is working with DOE researchers to develop a comprehensive approach that will address these issues by encompassing all the stages of data analysis from initial data generation, orchestration of analysis tasks, and effective visualization of the results.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware is supporting the DOE’s scientific teams with large-scale data analysis and visualization. This involves making enhancements and extensions to current tools, such as ParaView and VisIt; introducing and supporting new technologies leveraging many-core and multi-core architectures; and coupling data analysis capability with simulation codes for in-situ analysis and co-processing.

    Tom Munnecke Visits Kitware
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  In April, Kitware hosted Tom Munnecke, one of the world’s leading experts in health information technology and an original member of the VistA team, who gave a presentation titled “Towards a Federal Health Information Space.” He discussed his observations and lessons learned as one of the original architects of VistA and CHCS, and focused on the need for an open, adaptable health information space. To this end, he presented an architectural conceptual model based on an “Information Space” rather than a “Integrated System” that approaches the federal health information as a large-scale, fine-grained network of information and interactions. His recorded presentation is available on Kitware’s webinar page, www.kitware.com/products/webinars.html.

    Kitware Participates in the University at Albany Open Source Festival
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  Will Schroeder, Bill Hoffman, and Luis Ibáñez presented at the University at Albany Open Source Festival in March. The event, organized by the UAlbany Student Chapter of the American Society for Information Science &amp; Technology (ASIS&amp;T), brought together many groups invested in open source, along with others interested in learning more about the Way of the Source.
 </p>
 <p>
  Will gave a presentation titled “Open Source Business Models,” during which he spoke about the variety of business models that have been used to monetize open-source software and communities. Will discussed a variety of business approaches ranging from open source as a hobby to consulting, dual licensing, and collaborative R&amp;D, which is a major component of the Kitware model.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bill presented on “Open Source Quality Processes” and discussed how open-source practices result in higher-quality software due to the many eyes theory. Although not all open-source projects will benefit from this theory as much as the Linux kernel, there are open tools and processes that enable developers to share and test software regardless of community size. Tools including Git, CMake, CTest, and CDash are examples of freely-available tools for managing, building, and testing high-quality software – while also reducing maintenance costs and maximizing community involvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly, Luis Ibáñez gave two presentations, one on “Open Source in Healthcare” and another focused on “Open Source in Education”. In speaking on open source in healthcare, Luis introduced the economic relevance of healthcare costs in the U.S. He described how the open-source community can contribute to reducing the cost of healthcare while simultaneously increasing its quality by participating on the open-source initiatives surrounding the development of electronic health record (EHR) systems, such as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and the open-source EHR Agent (OSEHRA).
 </p>
 <p>
  In the “Open Source in Education” talk, Luis presented on how Kitware has partnered with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) since 2007 to offer an Open Source Software Practices class. In this class, students are exposed to basic principles of economics; models of peer-production; social principles of collaboration; the legal basis of copyrights, patents, and trademarks; principles of software licensing; and the motivational aspects of cooperation. Simultaneously, students are able to practice interaction skills with open-source communities through use of revision control systems, mailing lists, forums, wikis, code peer-review systems, software quality control, and documentation.

    ISBI 2012: ITK-focused Hackathons
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Kitware attended the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and participated in two ITK-related hackathons: integrating the NiftyReg library from University of College of London into ITK and integrating more ITK functionalities into Osirix. Over the two days of hackathons, Luis Ibáñez, Xiaoxiao Liu, and Matt McCormick met with several group to discuss ITK, new ideas, and potential collaborations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The NiftyReg hackathon focused on integrating the NiftyReg tool as an ITK module. NiftyReg is a package that performs Image Registration by taking advantage of GPUs. The NA-MIC / Slicer community has been interested in using this library; by including it as an external ITK module, it will be easier for the NA-MIC and ITK communities in general to get take advantage pf NiftyReg. The proposed course of action for the ITK team includes assisting with the configuration of an external module and testing.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the Osirix hackathon, Kitwareans worked with Jan Perhac from the Osirix team in Geneva and two researchers from the Polytechnic University of Catalunya (UPC): Raul Benitez and Oriol Carrillo. The hackathon focued on building an example ITK plugin for Osirix and discussing using ITK pipelines in Osirix for  Image Guided Surgery (IGS) applications. The Osirix team explained that the plugin infrastructure is in flux, but that once it is settled, there will be abundant opportunities for extending Osirix via ITK, IGSTK, and TubeTK plugins.
