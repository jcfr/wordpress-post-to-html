  As part of the project week, the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (

   NA-MIC

  ) community hosted a tutorial contest. The winning tutorial was selected based on the criteria that it introduced a method that has been contributed to
  <a href="http://slicer.org/">
   3D Slicer
  </a>
  and that it effectively showed others how to apply the new method to medical image analysis.
