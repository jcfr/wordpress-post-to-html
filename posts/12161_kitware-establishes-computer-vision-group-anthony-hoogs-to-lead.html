   Kitware, Inc. is pleased to announce the establishmemt of a computer vision group led by
   <a href="https://www.kitware.com/anthony-hoogs/">
    Dr. Anthony Hoogs
   </a>
   . Dr. Hoogs is a internationally recognized researcher who over the past fifteen years has supervised and performed research in various areas of computer vision including event, activity and behavior recognition, motion pattern learning and anomaly detection, visual semantics, tracking, learning, image segmentation, object recognition, and content-based retrieval. Dr. Hoogs received his PhD in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998 for research on image segmentation, object representation and learning in computer vision. Previously, he received his MS from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991 for research in algebraic object representation. He graduated with a BA Magna cum laude from Amherst College in 1989.

   At GE Global Research (1998-2007), Dr. Hoogs led a team of researchers in video and imagery analysis on projects sponsored by the US government, Lockheed Martin and NBC Universal. On a recent DARPA project, Predictive Analysis for Naval Deployment Activities, he led the development of algorithms for learning normal behavior and detecting abnormal behavior in commercial maritime shipping. He was also the PI for a research effort in wide-area target detection and change detection for DARPA’s Dynamic Database program. While pursuing his PhD, he worked full-time at Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems (1991-98). As the Chief Scientist on the Research and Development for Image Understanding Systems and Site Monitoring System programs, sponsored by DARPA and CIA, he developed automatic change detection algorithms and systems that were evaluated in operational government facilities and demonstrations.

   The expertise Dr. Hoogs brings to Kitware will synergistically amplify Kitware’s existing capabilities in supercomputing visualization, medical image analysis, software process, and open publication. It will also extend Kitware’s recent work in industrial inspection and wide-area surveillance.
