  Mastering CMake explains how to use the
  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">
   CMake
  </a>
  suite of tools, including CTest and CPack, to develop, build, test, and package software for distribution. It covers use of the command-line and GUI tools on Linux (UNIX), Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X. This book also contains a guide for converting projects to CMake and writing CMake code to specify build rules to compile sources, create static and shared libraries, link executables, run custom commands, run tests, and install artifacts. It also includes a copy of key portions of the official reference documentation.
