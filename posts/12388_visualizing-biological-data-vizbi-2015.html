   From March 23 to March 27, 2015, I attended the
  </span>
  <a href="http://www.vizbi.org/">
   VizBi conference
  </a>
  at the
  <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">
   Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
  </a>
  in Cambridge, MA. The conference featured the latest in visualizations in the life sciences community, including some impressive molecular animations.

  At the conference, I presented a
  <a href="http://www.vizbi.org/Posters/2015/C07">
   poster
  </a>
  (along with Curtis Lisle, Anthony Wehrer, Luke Harmon, Robert W. Thacker, Chelsea Specht, Charles Hughes, and Jorge Soberon) on the Arbor Workflows application for the
  <a href="http://www.arborworkflows.com/">
   Arbor phylogenetics project
  </a>
  . Arbor uses
  <a href="http://www.tangelohub.org/">
   TangeloHub
  </a>
  to host, edit, and share data, analyses, and visualizations in the cloud. It's current capabilities revolve around phylogenetics use cases.

    is another workflow framework that has made inroads into the life sciences communities. Some initial differentiators from our poster are that TangeloHub allows cross-language workflows (Python/R) and online analysis creation and editing.

    is a loose federation of npm packages for web visualization of life science data. It is an intriguing way to incorporate a diverse set of packages, and the community has gained some traction. The most interesting points of the tutorial were the use of
