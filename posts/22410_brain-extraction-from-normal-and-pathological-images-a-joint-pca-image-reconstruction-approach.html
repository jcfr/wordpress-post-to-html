  One of the problems that this team has been tackling is traumatic brain injury (TBI) assessment.  In particular, we are developing methods that help register MRI scans taken after a TBI with standard anatomic atlases, so that we can more accurately localize the regions and extent of damage.   The difficulty is that when major trauma has been sustained, it can be very difficult to map regions from the injured patient’s brain to a healthy atlas: tissues may have been drastically distorted, displaced, or destroyed.  We have been pursuing a variety of methods to address this difficult problem [

  ].   Recently we have generalized some of that work to the broader task of delineating the boundary of the brain in medical scans, including scans containing large pathologies / injuries.  Such “brain extraction” is a common step in many automated brain image analysis algorithms, including TBI analysis methods.  That work is featured in the following journal article that was authored by one of Marc’s students and that appeared in the April issue of NeuroImage:
