  My name Is Pat Marion; I’m an engineer at Kitware and part of the VES team. VES is the VTK OpenGL ES 2.0 Rendering Toolkit. We’ve already released a 0.0.2 version of
  <a href="http://kiwiviewer.org/">
   KiwiViewer
  </a>
  , the demonstration app for VES, on iPhone and iPad,
  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kiwiviewer/id455271681?mt=8">
   available in the App store
  </a>
  . We have a lot of things coming soon, including KiwiViewer for the Android market and new demos to show at
  <a href="http://visweek.org/">
   VisWeek 2011
  </a>
  .  Here’s a sneak peak at one of the demos-

  The VES git repo will be released early next month after another round or two of iterations. We’ve been doing a lot of iterations (usually just one or two weeks in length) for the past eight weeks to push VES forward as quickly as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s how the iterations proceed in our git repo: a new a topic branch is created and owned by one of the VES team members. Work-in-progress on the topic is staged so that other team members can try the feature, or simply read through the code.  Next, iterate (duh!) – the topic is merged to master as soon as we’re comfortable so that everyone can base new work on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this early stage in development, it is to everyone’s benefit to merge early. We keep a close eye on valgrind and benchmark the frames-per-second so that we never lose performance. Who cares if the merge comes with a few loose ends; those will be tied up in the next iteration, which starts now!
 </p>
 <p>
  And so, here we are, iterating on our code at high speed to prepare demos for VisWeek. Last week I added support for 2D text annotations using
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkFreeTypeStringToImage.html">
   VTK’s freetype classes
  </a>
  . The annotations can be anchored to 3D points on a mesh, allowing for updated annotation positions as the camera moves around the scene.  This feature was demonstrated in the demo video linked above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another demo in the iteration pipeline is basic animation support. Using
  <a href="http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/Animation.html">
   ParaView’s animation controls
  </a>
  , you can export animation geometries for viewing on mobile devices. The animation timeline is controlled with touch interaction, and in the next iteration we want to flex the VES render-to-texture functionality to generate keyframe thumbnails along the timeline.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll be showing these demos and more at VisWeek, including a 3D image slice widget and a mesh clipping widget, so we’ll see you there in Rhode Island! Come find us and our iPad and Android tablets at the Kitware table and stay tuned for a source code release announcement. As always, if you are interested in learning more about VES and our mobile visualization capabilities, please contact Kitware for more information.
