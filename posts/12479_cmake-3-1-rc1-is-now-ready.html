  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the more significant features of CMake 3.1 are:
 </p>
 <p>
  * Windows Phone and Windows Store support has been added to  Visual Studio 11
  <br/>
  (2012) and above Generators.
 </p>
 <p>
  * NVIDIA Nsight Tegra support has been added to  Visual Studio 10 (2010) and
  <br/>
  above Generators.
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "target_compile_features" command allows populating target based compile
  <br/>
  features. CMake uses this information to ensure that the compiler in use is
  <br/>
  capable of building the target, and to add any necessary compile flags
  <br/>
  such as -std=gnu++11 to support language features.
  <br/>
  More information on this is found at:

   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.1/manual/cmake-compile-features.7.html
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  * The syntax for *Variable References* and *Escape Sequences* was simplified in
  <br/>
  order to allow a much faster implementation. See policy "CMP0053".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "if" command no longer automatically dereferences variables named in
  <br/>
  quoted or bracket arguments.  See policy "CMP0054".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The target property "SOURCES" now generally supports "Generator Expressions".
  <br/>
  The generator expressions may be used in the "add_library" and
  <br/>
  "add_executable" commands.
 </p>
 <p>
  * It is now possible to write and append to the target property "SOURCES".
  <br/>
  The variable "CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES" can be used to trace the
  <br/>
  origin of sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  * CPack gained "7Z" and "TXZ" generators supporting lzma-compressed archives.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The ExternalProject module has learned to support lzma-compressed
  <br/>
  source tarballs with ".7z", ".tar.xz", and ".txz" extensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The ExternalProject module ExternalProject_Add command learned a new
  <br/>
  BUILD_ALWAYS option to cause the external project build step to run every
  <br/>
  time the host project is built.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The ctest_coverage command learned to support Intel coverage files with the
  <br/>
  "codecov" tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The ctest_memcheck command learned to support sanitizer modes, including
  <br/>
  "AddressSanitizer", "MemorySanitizer", "ThreadSanitizer", and
  <br/>
  "UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer".
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features:
 </p>
 <p>
  * In CMake 3.0 the "target_link_libraries" command accidentally began allowing
  <br/>
  unquoted arguments to use Generator Expressions containing a semicolon
  <br/>
  separated list within them. For example:
 </p>
 <p>
  set(libs B C)
  <br/>
  target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${libs}&gt;)
 </p>
 <p>
  This is equivalent to writing:
 </p>
 <p>
  target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:B C&gt;)
 </p>
 <p>
  and was never intended to work. It did not work in CMake 2.8.12.
  <br/>
  Such generator expressions should be in quoted arguments:
 </p>
 <p>
  set(libs B C)
  <br/>
  target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC "$&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${libs}&gt;")
 </p>
 <p>
  CMake 3.1 again requires the quotes for this to work correctly.

 </p>
 <p>
  Documentation Changes
  <br/>
  =====================
 </p>
 <p>
  * A new "cmake-compile-features(7)" manual was added.
 </p>
 <p>
  New Features
  <br/>
  ============
 </p>
 <p>
  Generators
  <br/>
  ———-
 </p>
 <p>
  * A "Visual Studio 14" generator was added.
 </p>
 <p>
  Windows Phone and Windows Store
  <br/>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 </p>
 <p>
  * Generators for Visual Studio 11 (2012) and above learned to
  <br/>
  generate projects for Windows Phone and Windows Store.  One may set
  <br/>
  the "CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" variable to "WindowsPhone" or "WindowsStore"
  <br/>
  on the "cmake(1)" command-line or in a "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" to
  <br/>
  activate these platforms. Also set "CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION" to "8.0"
  <br/>
  or "8.1" to specify the version of Windows to be targeted.
 </p>
 <p>
  NVIDIA Nsight Tegra
  <br/>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 </p>
 <p>
  * Generators for Visual Studio 10 (2010) and above learned to
  <br/>
  generate projects for NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition.
  <br/>
  One may set the "CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME" variable to "Android" on the
  <br/>
  "cmake(1)" command-line or in a "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" to activate
  <br/>
  this platform.
 </p>
 <p>
  Syntax
  <br/>
  ——
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cmake-language(7)" syntax for *Variable References* and
  <br/>
  *Escape Sequences* was simplified in order to allow a much faster
  <br/>
  implementation.  See policy "CMP0053".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "if()" command no longer automatically dereferences variables
  <br/>
  named in quoted or bracket arguments.  See policy "CMP0054".
 </p>
 <p>
  Commands
  <br/>
  ——–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "add_custom_command()" command learned to interpret "cmake-
  <br/>
  generator-expressions(7)" in arguments to "DEPENDS".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "export(PACKAGE)" command learned to check the
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY" variable to skip exporting the
  <br/>
  package.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "file(STRINGS)" command gained a new "ENCODING" option to
  <br/>
  enable extraction of "UTF-8" strings.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "find_package()" command learned to check the
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY" and
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY" variables to skip
  <br/>
  searching the package registries.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install()" command learned a "MESSAGE_NEVER" option to avoid
  <br/>
  output during installation.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "string()" command learned a new "GENEX_STRIP" subcommand
  <br/>
  which removes "generator expression".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "string()" command learned a new "UUID" subcommand to generate
  <br/>
  a univerally unique identifier.
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "target_compile_features()" command allows populating the
  <br/>
  "COMPILE_FEATURES" target property, just like any other build
  <br/>
  variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "target_sources()" command was added to add to the "SOURCES"
  <br/>
  target property.
 </p>
 <p>
  Variables
  <br/>
  ———
 </p>
 <p>
  * The Visual Studio generators for versions 8 (2005) and above
  <br/>
  learned to read the target platform name from a new
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM" variable when it is not specified as part
  <br/>
  of the generator name.  The platform name may be specified on the
  <br/>
  "cmake(1)" command line with the "-A" option, e.g. "-G "Visual
  <br/>
  Studio 12 2013" -A x64".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET" variable may now be initialized in a
  <br/>
  toolchain file specified by the "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" variable.
  <br/>
  This is useful when cross-compiling with the Xcode or Visual Studio
  <br/>
  generators.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE" variable was introduced to optionally
  <br/>
  reduce output installation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Properties
  <br/>
  ———-
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "CXX_STANDARD" and "CXX_EXTENSIONS" target properties may
  <br/>
  specify values which CMake uses to compute required compile options
  <br/>
  such as "-std=c++11" or "-std=gnu++11". The "CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD" and
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS" variables may be set to initialize the target
  <br/>
  properties.
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "C_STANDARD" and "C_EXTENSIONS" target properties may specify
  <br/>
  values which CMake uses to compute required compile options such as
  <br/>
  "-std=c11" or "-std=gnu11". The "CMAKE_C_STANDARD" and
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS" variables may be set to initialize the target
  <br/>
  properties.
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "COMPILE_FEATURES" target property may contain a list of
  <br/>
  features required to compile a target.  CMake uses this information
  <br/>
  to ensure that the compiler in use is capable of building the
  <br/>
  target, and to add any necessary compile flags to support language
  <br/>
  features.
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "COMPILE_PDB_NAME" and "COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" target
  <br/>
  properties were introduced to specify the MSVC compiler program
  <br/>
  database file location ("cl /Fd").  This complements the existing
  <br/>
  "PDB_NAME" and "PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" target properties that specify
  <br/>
  the linker program database file location ("link /pdb").
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES" target property now supports a
  <br/>
  "$&lt;LINK_ONLY:…&gt;" "generator expression".
 </p>
 <p>
  * A new "INTERFACE_SOURCES" target property was introduced. This is
  <br/>
  consumed by dependent targets, which compile and link the listed
  <br/>
  sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "SOURCES" target property now contains "generator expression"
  <br/>
  such as "TARGET_OBJECTS" when read at configure time, if policy
  <br/>
  "CMP0051" is "NEW".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "SOURCES" target property now generally supports "generator
  <br/>
  expression".  The generator expressions may be used in the
  <br/>
  "add_library()" and "add_executable()" commands.
 </p>
 <p>
  * It is now possible to write and append to the "SOURCES" target
  <br/>
  property.  The "CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES" variable may be used
  <br/>
  to trace the origin of sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  * A "VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT" source file property was added to tell
  <br/>
  the Visual Studio generators to mark content for deployment in
  <br/>
  Windows Phone and Windows Store projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "VS_WINRT_COMPONENT" target property was created to tell
  <br/>
  Visual Studio generators to compile a shared library as a Windows
  <br/>
  Runtime (WinRT) component.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Xcode" generator learned to check source file properties
  <br/>
  "XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE" and "XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE" for a
  <br/>
  custom Xcode file reference type.
 </p>
 <p>
  Modules
  <br/>
  ——-
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "BundleUtilities" module learned to resolve and replace
  <br/>
  "@rpath" placeholders on OS X to correctly bundle applications using
  <br/>
  them.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMakePackageConfigHelpers" module
  <br/>
  "configure_package_config_file()" command learned a new
  <br/>
  "INSTALL_PREFIX" option to generate package configuration files
  <br/>
  meant for a prefix other than "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CheckFortranSourceCompiles" module was added to provide a
  <br/>
  "CHECK_Fortran_SOURCE_COMPILES" macro.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalData" module learned to tolerate a "DATA{}" reference
  <br/>
  to a missing source file with a warning instead of rejecting it with
  <br/>
  an error.  This helps developers write new "DATA{}" references to
  <br/>
  test reference outputs that have not yet been created.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module learned to support lzma-compressed
  <br/>
  source tarballs with ".7z", ".tar.xz", and ".txz" extensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add" command learned
  <br/>
  a new "BUILD_ALWAYS" option to cause the external project build step
  <br/>
  to run every time the host project is built.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add" command learned
  <br/>
  a new "EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" option to cause the external project target
  <br/>
  to have the "EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" target property set.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add_Step" command
  <br/>
  learned a new "EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN" option to cause the step to not be
  <br/>
  a direct dependency of the main external project target.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add" command learned
  <br/>
  a new "DOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS" option to disable progress output while
  <br/>
  downloading the source tarball.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FeatureSummary" module "feature_summary" API learned to
  <br/>
  accept multiple values for the "WHAT" option and combine them
  <br/>
  appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindCUDA" module learned to support "fatbin" and "cubin"
  <br/>
  modules.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindGTest" module "gtest_add_tests" macro learned a new
  <br/>
  "AUTO" option to automatically read the "SOURCES" target property of
  <br/>
  the test executable and scan the source files for tests to be added.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindGLEW" module now provides imported targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindGLUT" module now provides imported targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindHg" module gained a new "Hg_WC_INFO" macro to help run
  <br/>
  "hg" to extract information about a Mercurial work copy.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindOpenCL" module was introduced.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindOpenGL" module now provides imported targets "OpenGL::GL"
  <br/>
  and "OpenGL::GLU" when the libraries are found.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindOpenMP" module learned to support Fortran.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindPkgConfig" module learned to use the "PKG_CONFIG"
  <br/>
  environment variable value as the "pkg-config" executable, if set.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindVTK" module dropped support for finding VTK 4.0. It is
  <br/>
  now a thin-wrapper around "find_package(VTK … NO_MODULE)". This
  <br/>
  produces much clearer error messages when VTK is not found.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindZLIB" module now provides imported targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "GenerateExportHeader" module "generate_export_header"
  <br/>
  function learned to allow use with *Object Libraries*.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "InstallRequiredSystemLibraries" module gained a new
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES" option to install MSVC OpenMP
  <br/>
  runtime libraries.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "UseSWIG" module learned to detect the module name from ".i"
  <br/>
  source files if possible to avoid the need to set the
  <br/>
  "SWIG_MODULE_NAME" source file property explicitly.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "WriteCompilerDetectionHeader" module was added to allow
  <br/>
  creation of a portable header file for compiler optional feature
  <br/>
  detection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generator Expressions
  <br/>
  ———————
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "COMPILE_FEATURES" "generator expression" allows setting build
  <br/>
  properties based on available compiler features.
 </p>
 <p>
  CTest
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ctest_coverage()" command learned to read variable
  <br/>
  "CTEST_COVERAGE_EXTRA_FLAGS" to set "CoverageExtraFlags".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ctest_coverage()" command learned to support Intel coverage
  <br/>
  files with the "codecov" tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ctest_memcheck()" command learned to support sanitizer modes,
  <br/>
  including "AddressSanitizer", "MemorySanitizer", "ThreadSanitizer",
  <br/>
  and "UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer". Options may be set using the new
  <br/>
  "CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SANITIZER_OPTIONS" variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  CPack
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * "cpack(1)" gained an "IFW" generator to package using Qt Framework
  <br/>
  Installer tools.  See the "CPackIFW" module.
 </p>
 <p>
  * "cpack(1)" gained "7Z" and "TXZ" generators supporting lzma-
  <br/>
  compressed archives.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackDeb" module learned a new
  <br/>
  "CPACK_DEBIAN_COMPRESSION_TYPE" variable to set the tarball
  <br/>
  compression type.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cpack(1)" "WiX" generator learned to support a
  <br/>
  "CPACK_WIX_ACL" installed file property to specify an Access Control
  <br/>
  List.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cmake(1)" "-E" option learned a new "env" command.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cmake(1)" "-E tar" command learned to support lzma-compressed
  <br/>
  files.
 </p>
 <p>
  * *Object Libraries* may now have extra sources that do not compile
  <br/>
  to object files so long as they would not affect linking of a normal
  <br/>
  library (e.g. ".dat" is okay but not ".def").
 </p>
 <p>
  * Visual Studio generators for VS 8 and later learned to support the
  <br/>
  "ASM_MASM" language.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The Visual Studio generators learned to treat ".hlsl" source files
  <br/>
  as High Level Shading Language sources (using "FXCompile" in
  <br/>
  ".vcxproj" files).  A "VS_SHADER_TYPE" source file property was
  <br/>
  added to specify the Shader Type.
 </p>
 <p>
  New Diagnostics
  <br/>
  ===============
 </p>
 <p>
  * Policy "CMP0052" introduced to control directories in the
  <br/>
  "INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES" of exported targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features
  <br/>
  ===============================
 </p>
 <p>
  * In CMake 3.0 the "target_link_libraries()" command accidentally
  <br/>
  began allowing unquoted arguments to use "generator expressions"
  <br/>
  containing a (";" separated) list within them.  For example:
 </p>
 <p>
  set(libs B C)
  <br/>
  target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${libs}&gt;)
 </p>
 <p>
  This is equivalent to writing:
 </p>
 <p>
  target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:B C&gt;)
 </p>
 <p>
  and was never intended to work.  It did not work in CMake 2.8.12.
  <br/>
  Such generator expressions should be in quoted arguments:
 </p>
 <p>
  set(libs B C)
  <br/>
  target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC "$&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${libs}&gt;")
 </p>
 <p>
  CMake 3.1 again requires the quotes for this to work correctly.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Callbacks established by the "variable_watch()" command will no
  <br/>
  longer receive the "ALLOWED_UNKNOWN_READ_ACCESS" access type when
  <br/>
  the undocumented "CMAKE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS" variable
  <br/>
  is set.  Uninitialized variable accesses will always be reported as
  <br/>
  "UNKNOWN_READ_ACCESS".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMakeDetermineVSServicePack" module now warns that it is
  <br/>
  deprecated and should not longer be used.  Use the
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION" variable instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other Changes
  <br/>
  =============
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cmake-gui(1)" learned to capture output from child processes
  <br/>
  started by the "execute_process()" command and display it in the
  <br/>
  output window.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cmake-language(7)" internal implementation of generator
  <br/>
  expression and list expansion parsers have been optimized and shows
  <br/>
  non-trivial speedup on large projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The Makefile generators learned to use response files with GNU
  <br/>
  tools on Windows to pass library directories and names to the
  <br/>
  linker.
 </p>
 <p>
  * When generating linker command-lines, CMake now avoids repeating
  <br/>
  items corresponding to SHARED library targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Support for the Open Watcom compiler has been overhauled. The
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID" is now "OpenWatcom", and the
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION" now uses the Open Watcom external
  <br/>
  version numbering.  The external version numbers are lower than the
  <br/>
  internal version number by 11.
 </p>
