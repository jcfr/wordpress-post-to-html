  The SPIE Medical Imaging Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Workshop will be held on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, from 17.45 – 19.45 as part of the SPIE Medical Imaging conference in Orlando, Florida, USA.
 </p>
 <p>
  This year’s CAD workshop will continue the series of successful workshops at previous SPIE MI CAD conferences. The main part of the workshop will once again be live demonstrations by teams of CAD developers from mammography, lung CT, colon CT, and others.  Commercial, proprietary, open-source, and work-in-progress systems are welcome. Demonstrations may feature CAD, segmentation, registration, visualization, data mining, bioinformatics, and related algorithms and applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  The workshop will start with a short overview of the participating teams and systems. Next, the audience can interact with the teams during live demonstrations of the systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  New this year, we are encouraging the use of public data in the demonstrations. Researchers are also encouraged to make their own data publicly available. The website will be updated as new datasets are submitted. Participation in this public data component of the workshop is purely voluntary.
 </p>
 <p>
  This workshop provides a unique opportunity to see and experience how advanced CAD systems perform and to discuss their design and use with developers. We look forward to amazing demonstrations, lively discussions, and fosting new discoveries and collaborations. Those interested in giving a demonstration are invited to submit a short description of the system they would like to demonstrate.
