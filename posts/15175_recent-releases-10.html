    ParaView 5.1
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView 5.1 brought the process of ray tracing to the open-source application for data analysis and visualization. This process utilizes the OSPRay library from Intel. The latest release also brought the capability to render picture-in-picture visualizations to ParaView.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of rendering capabilities, ParaView gained several filters with the release. A new collection of filters interpolates point clouds to line, plane, and regular volume meshes, including smoothed-particle hydrodynmics (SPH) interpolation. Another filter efficiently resamples large unstructured grids to generate regular grids.

  In other news, the 5.1 release refactored the zero-copy infrastructure in ParaView to pass data arrays with arbitrary memory layouts to ParaView Catalyst. As a result, ParaView uses less overhead when it accesses the arrays in filters. The release also refactored three-dimensional (3D) widgets so that applications can more efficiently employ them.
 </p>
 <p>
  With additional improvements, ParaView gained new functionality. For example, the release made it possible to simultaneously look at multiple blocks in composite data sets. The release also made it possible to rename views.

    CMake 3.6
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier this summer, CMake 3.6 became available to the software development community. With the 3.6 release, the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   Visual Studio 14 2015
  </span>
  generator obtained experimental support for the Clang/C2 toolset. In addition, the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   list()
  </span>
  command received a
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   FILTER
  </span>
  sub-command, which filters list elements by regular expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  The release also added a variable that informs the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   try_compile()command
  </span>
  to build a static library instead of an executable. The variable,
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE
  </span>
  , applies to cross-compiling toolchains that cannot link binaries without custom flags or scripts.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, the release introduced the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">
   &lt;LANG&gt;
   <em>
    CLANG_TIDY
   </em>
  </span>
  target property and the
