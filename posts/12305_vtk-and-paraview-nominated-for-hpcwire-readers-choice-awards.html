  We would really appreciate your support and your vote this year. Although both VTK and ParaView are nominated, and we would appreciate very much votes for either, we would like to encourage support for VTK this year.

  2015 has been a year of major advancement for VTK (and therefore ParaView, which leverages VTK heavily) in the area of high-performance computing (HPC). The most notable effort toward next-generation computing is
  <a href="http://m.vtk.org">
   VTK-m
  </a>
  . This emerging effort, which significantly improves our ability to compute on GPUs and massively multi-core CPUs, will be our main infrastructure to support next-generation supercomputers such as the upcoming Cori, Trinity, Summit, Sierra and Aurora, all of which feature massive parallelism through the use of GPUs of Intel Xeon Phi processors.

 <div>
  We also have a number of other efforts, including vtkSMP, which aims to introduce multi-threaded parallelism and, together with VTK-m, helps us close any performance holds on multi-core systems; Intel IPCC with TACC, which focuses on better leveraging vector units on CPUs; and last-but-not-least, our next generation OpenGL efforts, which focus on significant rendering improvements on modern GPUs, as well as Intel's upcoming OpenSWR software rendering library.

 <div>
  As these technologies mature and are deployed over the next few months, expect major performance boosts in VTK and ParaView.
