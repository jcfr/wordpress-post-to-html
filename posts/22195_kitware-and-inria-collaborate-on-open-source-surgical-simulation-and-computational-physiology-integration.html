   Pulse is an open source comprehensive virtual human physiology simulator for medical education, research, and training. The engine models various patients through modular interconnected systems and is equipped to dynamically apply any combination of chronic conditions, acute traumas, and treatments. Pulse also includes a common data model that standardizes ontology, data definitions, and interfaces to promote their synthesis with other systems.
