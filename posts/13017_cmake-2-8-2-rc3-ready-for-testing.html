  The CMake 2.8.2 release candidate stream continues! You can find the source and binaries here:

 <p>
  If we do not get any reports of regressions from previous releases of CMake, this release candidate will become the final 2.8.2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since we switched to git, and a new workflow, we’re expecting to do more frequent releases. Because of that, our release candidate phases will be shorter than they have been historically. So, if you want to test this out and ask for a fix, do it soon, or hold your peace till the next release!
 </p>
 <p>
  Following is the list of changes in this release. Since we switched to git, this list is now the ‘git log’ one line summary written by the named CMake developers.
