  On October 2nd 2014, we held a hackathon to reduce the number of issues in the VTK bug tracker in anticipation of VTK’s migration to a new bug tracker (as part of migrating to Gitlab probably). We also hope to come to a place where we triage bugs early and keep the issue tracker relatively clean.

  It was awesome working alongside these brilliant folks to improve VTK. Of course, we had to occasionally poke fun at the original developers (all 3 were there!) and blame them for some of the issues; all in good fun.

  Before the hackathon, we had 189 open bugs. After the hackathon, we have 118 bugs. But that’s not all, there is still a lot of code in Gerrit review. So if we include those, we are down to 91 bugs! So we closed a whopping 98 bugs in 1 day. To be fair, we closed many bugs because they were already fixed or contained feature requests that we didn’t want to implement but we also fixed a large number of real issues. To see the list of bugs that we closed, check out

  and look at the bugs that were closed around 10/2 2014. This list will grow as the changes currently in Gerrit review makes into master. The icing on the cake is that we have very little dashboard issues that resulted from the hackathon. Those should be resolved very soon.

  After the hackathon, some of us went to

   Salty’s

  for some grub and beers. Overall very successful and fun hackathon. I am already looking forward to the next one.
