  The second release candidate for VTK 8.2.0 is ready to try.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can get it from the downloads page,
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/download/#candidate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   http://www.vtk.org/download/#candidate
  </a>
  or from git with the 8.2.0.rc2 tag.
 </p>
 <p>
  The changes over rc1 consist of a handful of bug fixes, most notably a change to fix python wheel building. Things could turn up in testing of course, but I anticipate that this version will be retagged as 8.2.0 final in about two weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The full set of changes over v8.2.0.rc1 are
 </p>
 <p>
  Brad King (1):
  <br/>
  cmake: Set policy CMP0083 explicitly to avoid warnings
 </p>
 <p>
  Cory Quammen (3):
  <br/>
  Remove direct disable of GL_SCISSOR_TEST
  <br/>
  Silence viewport warnings
  <br/>

 </p>

 </p>

  <a href="https://www.gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   bug tracker

  so that we can try to address them before VTK 8.2.0 final. Kindly set the
  <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/milestones/10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

  </a>
  on your issue and merge requests for 8.2 to ensure that they are tracked during the remainder of the release process. Further, please base / rebase all 8.2 target branches off of the v8.2.0.rc1 tag to ensure minimal merge conflicts with the release and master branches.
