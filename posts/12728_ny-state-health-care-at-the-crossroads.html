 <p>

 </p>
 <ul>

   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    Dr. Nirav R. Shah, New York State Health Commissioner
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">

    , St. Peter’s Health Partners
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
   The event gathered close to 400 attendees, and covered a very interesting set of topics.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
   In particular
  </span>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    The unrolling of the
    <a href="http://healthbenefitexchange.ny.gov/">
     NY Health Exchange
    </a>
    , one of the first
    <a href="http://healthreform.kff.org/faq/what-is-a-health-insurance-exchange.aspx">
     Health Insurance Exchanges
    </a>
    to be deployed as part of the Healthcare Reform. The
    <a href="http://healthbenefitexchange.ny.gov/what-exchange">
     Exchange is essentially an open market
    </a>
    where individuals and organizations can shop for healthcare coverage.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    The need to drive health care towards outpatient (not in the hospital) care
   </span>
  </li>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
     As the most important measure to reduce health care cost.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
     To that end, the need for investing on Home Care and Telemedicine
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
     The creation of urgent care facilities in neighborhoods (as alternatives to visits to Hospital Emergency Rooms).
     <br/>
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    The need to change the culture of
    <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Overtreated.html?id=f8H124zvldwC">
     “over-treatment”
    </a>
    , on the assumption that “more is better”.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    The creation of a system to request second-opinions electronically.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    Curiously NY State has brought down the cost of healthcare per capita by 9%, from $10K  to $9K.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    The adoption of EHRs in NY State seems to have reached 50%.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    The economics are driving independent doctors offices to be acquired by larger practices.
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
   <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    In the path toward reducing cost an improving quality, a cultural transformation is needed, in which Doctors would become comfortable give up control, to some degree to nurses and to some degree to EHRs.
    <br/>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
   One of the most revealing arguments was made by the NY State Health Commissioner, indicating that another key cultural change that is sorely needed is to
   <strong>
    move beyond the notion of competition
   </strong>
   , and the perception that the economics in health care are a zero-sum game, where the earning of one entity must be the loses of another, and instead, move towards
   <strong>
    Collaboration
   </strong>
   and the
   <strong>
    Creation of Value through Sharing
   </strong>
   .  Curiously, two concepts that are well known in
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production">
    peer-production
   </a>
   and
   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8U0SIFUTEs">
    open source economics
   </a>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
   Both concepts have been nicely explained by Yochai Benkler:
