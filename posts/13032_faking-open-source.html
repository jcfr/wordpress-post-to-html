  The popularity of Free and Open Source Software (
  <strong>
   FOSS
  </strong>
  ) has attracted a collection of projects and organizations that are keen on benefiting from the good reputation of Free and Open Source Software, but are not committed to its principles or its practices.
 </p>
 <p>
  For lack of a better name, lets call these projects
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <strong>
   NRFOSS
  </strong>
  “:
  <strong>
   Not Really Free and Open Source Software
  </strong>

   NRFOSS
  </strong>
  is sometimes the result of lack of education on Open Source (the “confused” projects), while sometimes it is the result of an intentional misrepresentation guided by questionable goals (the “evil” projects). Both of these categories are bad for FOSS, since they drain energy from the good intentions of potential adopters and contributors, and also taint the reputation of real
  <strong>
   FOSS
  </strong>
  projects.

  </strong>
  from real
  <strong>
   FOSS
  </strong>
