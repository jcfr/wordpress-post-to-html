  This course provides an introduction to the CMake cross-platform build  tool used by many open-source and commercial development projects  world-wide. Using a tutorial format, this course introduces the concept  of the basic CMakeLists configuration file for a simple project, then  expands upon this to cover setting include paths, adding libraries,  having version numbers and configured header files, installing the  resulting binaries, testing, and reporting testing results on a  dashboard.
