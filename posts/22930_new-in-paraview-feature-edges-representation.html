  Seeing the bounding box of a dataset is easy with ParaView’s
  <b>
   Outline
  </b>
  representation. But if you wanted to see a slightly more faithful representation without fully rendering the 3D surface there was no convenient way to do that. We have added a new representation called
  <b>
   Feature Edges
  </b>
  that is in still an outline but shows more detail of the dataset’s shape. This representation is similar to  the
  <b>
   Wireframe
  </b>
  representation of the dataset, but removes all edges except the edges where the surface angle changes sharply. The result is the outline of the data’s interesting geometric features. Here is a screenshot of ParaView rendering the bake.ex2 test dataset with both the
  <b>
   Outline
  </b>
  representation (left) and the new
  <b>
   Feature Edges
  </b>
  representation (right).

  This new representation is merged to ParaView’s master branch and will be included in ParaView 5.6 (released this fall). We hope you find it useful!
