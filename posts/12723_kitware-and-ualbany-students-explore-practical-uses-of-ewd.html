  As part of the Web Development class at
  <a href="http://www.albany.edu/cci/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   SUNY Albany
  </a>
  , Dr. Luis Ibáñez has been working in collaboration with instructor Dima Kassab to prepare a series of hands-on activities that introduce students to the practical use of
  <a href="http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/download/EWD_Sencha_Touch2_Reference.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   EWD
  </a>
  , the web application development framework that has been designed for use with GTM and Caché implementations of the
  <a href="http://opensource.com/health/12/2/join-m-revolution">
   M language
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="https://www.opensourcesoftwarepractice.org/OSDB-Tutorial/M/index.html">
   M Database
  </a>
  , that are widely
  <a href="https://www.opensourcesoftwarepractice.org/OSDB-Tutorial/M/WhoUsesIt.html">
   used
  </a>
  in Electronic Health Records.

 <p>
  In particular, the group has focused on the use of
  <a href="http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/main/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   EWD
  </a>
  in conjunction with the
  <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Sencha Touch framework
  </a>
  for mobile devices.

 <p>
  Here are the supporting slides used for the first two sessions of these activities:

   </a>

 </ul>
 <p>
  During the exercises, students created basic EWD pages that they were then able to access from phones and tablets. Each one of the sessions took about one hour, and was mostly performed by students at their own pace, while two instructors moved through the room providing assistance as needed. An Ubuntu Linux Sever was set up in the Amazon EC2 cloud, for which all students were provided user accounts.

  To make these educational materials available to the larger community, the group will be creating an Amazon EC2 image that replicates the configuration being used in the class. In this way, anyone who wants to will be able to create VM instances from this image and use them to follow the tutorials.
