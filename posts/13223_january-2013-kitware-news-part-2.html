    Kitware Europe Celebrates 2nd Anniversary
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  November 8th marked the second anniversary of Kitware Europe in Lyon, France. Since its inception, the Lyon office has been actively providing professional training courses throughout Europe. They’ve also made important collaborations with organizations such as the French Nuclear Agency (CEA) to develop new tools for VTK and ParaView, and with IRCAD to develop mobile and online visualization tools that use VES and Midas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware Europe is now a member of the European pole of competence in high-performance simulation (Ter@tec), and the Lyon-Biopole French pole of competence, for which they’ve been awarded a grant for performing magnetic resonance image simulation with several other French institutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their success has led to the addition of new team members, upping the count to five. Looking to the future, Kitware Europe plans to expand their course offerings, and continue seeking consortium opportunities to contribute technical and open-source expertise for the advancement of science.

    Kitware Attends Supercomputing 2012
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Kitware attended, exhibited, and presented at SC12 in Salt Lake City, Utah in November. This was Kitware’s first year with an exhibit booth at the conference, and our team was able to interact with many of our HPC customers and
  <br/>
  collaborators.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to exhibiting, we presented two collaborative tutorials. The first, “Large Scale Visualization with ParaView” was presented by Kenneth Moreland, W. Alan Scott, and Nathan Fabian from Sandia National Laboratories, and Utkarsh Ayachit and Robert Maynard from Kitware; this tutorial featured guidance on visualizing the massive simulations run on today’s supercomputers, and introduced the audience to scripting and extending ParaView.

  <br/>
  The second tutorial, “In-Situ Visualization with Catalyst” was led by Nathan D. Fabian and Ron A. Oldfield from Sandia National Laboratories; Andrew Bauer and Utkarsh Ayachit from Kitware; and Norbert Podhorszki from Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This tutorial demonstrated two methods of performing in-situ visualization using Catalyst, ParaView’s co-processing library. Attendees learned various methods of applying Catalyst in their projects including how to build pipelines for Catalyst; how the API is structured; how to bind it to C, C++, Fortran, and Python; and how to build Catalyst for HPC architectures.

  We’re looking forward to attending SC13 in Denver, Colorado, where we will be exhibiting in booth #4207.

    ParaView for Climate Scientists Presented at AGU Fall Meeting
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  Aashish Chaudhary attended the 45th annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, CA this December, where he presented “ParaView for Climate Scientists”. His talk described the integration of ParaView with the Ultrascale Visualization- Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) framework, a powerful and complete front-end to a rich set of visual-data exploration and analysis capabilities well suited for climate-data analysis problems. The integration leverages ParaView’s Python interface, and includes various new features that have been added to both tools to target climate data, including new readers, filters, and parallel spatiotemporal capabilities.

    Marcus Hanwell Featured on Nature Soapbox Science Series
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Marcus Hanwell, Technical Leader at Kitware was featured in a Soapbox Science series on Nature.com this Fall. His article, “PhDelta: The Road Less Travelled – From PhD to Software Development” discusses how his journey from  studying Experimental Physics in academia to becoming a software developer in industry was largely influenced by the ideals of Open Access publishing and open dissemination of scientific knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Hanwell leads the Open Chemistry project at Kitware, which includes the development of a suite of open-source tools to tackle big problems in chemistry, biochemistry, materials sciences, and other related areas.
