  The Kitware web site, www.kitware.com, has been restructured in order to better support the growing line of products and services that Kitware provides. Customers will find the site easier to navigate, and the seamless integration with the Kitware on-line store makes ordering products simple to do. The most requested information on the Visualization Toolkit has been included directly on the Kitware site, while the link to the existing vtk web pages remains available. In addition, the new Team pages reveal the people behind Kitware.
