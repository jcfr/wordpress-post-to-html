  On March 1, 2013, Kitware and the MSVTK partners announced the first release of the Multi-Scale Visualization Toolkit (MSVTK). This new open-source library is based on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and the Calibration Toolkit (CTK) to provide interactive visualization of multi-scale and multi-temporal data, as well as software components that are general enough to be used in any biomedical software project with multi-scale visualization issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  MSVTK extends VTK by adding new tools such as readers or widgets. The library also contains custom Qt/VTK widgets. Each tool is designed with the VTK paradigm in mind, so it can easily fit into any application already using VTK.
 </p>
