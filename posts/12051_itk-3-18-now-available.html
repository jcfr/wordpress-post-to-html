  Thanks to Michel Audette, BSplineDeformableTransform now clones its bulk transform in the multi-threaded image registration metrics. Bill Lorensen’s work on GDCMImageIO computation of proper orientation and origin has enhabced MR Image Storage for DICOM images. Mattes Mutual Information metric now works on binary images. Thanks to Serena Fabri and Hans Johnson for reporting this bug. Brad Lowenkamp and Kent Williams fixed support for analyzing images of large size. The behavior of the VTKPolyDataReader was fixed by Bill Lorensen.

  Affine registration of 3D images with Mean Squares metrics, affine registration of 2D binary images using MatchCardinalityMetric and AmoebaOptimizer, and computation of bounding boxes for segmented images were added in Insight. Extraction of iso-surfaces from segmented images and generation of screenshots from iso-surfaces were added in Insight Applications.
