  The second release candidate for the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) 4.10 is now ready to test. In addition to the new remote module that we discussed in our blog entry on the
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/itk-4-10-release-candidate-1-presents-new-remote-module/">
   first release candidate
  </a>
  , version 4.10 features many improvements to the filters and core of ITK. For example,
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier">

  Version 4.10 extends
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier">
   constexpr
  </span>
  usage with
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier">
   ITK_CONSTEXPR
  </span>
  and
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier">
   ITKCONSTEXPR_FUNC
  </span>
  macros, and it improves the
  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier">
   EXERCISE_BASIC_OBJECT_METHODS
  </span>
  testing macro. It also enables ITK to build faster, have better class coverage, and load more rapidly at runtime. Other benefits to ITK include a smaller binary size and a simplified process for building an external module against an ITK build tree.
