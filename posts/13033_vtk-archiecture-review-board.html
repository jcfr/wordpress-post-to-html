  I just wanted to take the opportunity to tell you about what has been happening with the VTK ARB (architecture review board). The ARB was formed last year to facilitate forward progress in VTK. It is a task force consisting of researchers around the world that was formed to work out the details required to make important changes, such as release schedules and moving to git repository. The ARB wants your input, and wants to be transparent about its discussions and decisions. A page describing the ARB is located at
