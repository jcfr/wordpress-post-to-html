  Kitware, Inc. has won a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from the DOE to develop a scalable, grid enabled, collaborative visualization environment to support the emerging distributed computing network. Grid computing is viewed by many technologists as a promising software technology to leverage distributed resources across the internet, allowing organizations to utilize distant resources and access remote data. Kitware will integrate selected software systems into the Grid framework, and produce three prototype applications demonstrating isocontouring, large data rendering, and deformable registration.
