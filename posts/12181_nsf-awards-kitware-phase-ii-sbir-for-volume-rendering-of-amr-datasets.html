  The National Science Foundation has Awarded Kitware a Phase II SBIR for volume rendering of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data. AMR data is used by many scientists and engineers to simulate processes such as astrophysical dynamics, combustion, fluid flow, and hydrodynamics. Volume rendering is a technique to “see into” 3D data much like an X-ray. By developing the ability to volume render AMR data, Kitware will extend the power of AMR simulations, and provide researchers with a new tool to visualize their data.
