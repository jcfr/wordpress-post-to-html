  An open call to imaging researchers:
 </p>
 <p>
  This blog is asking for your guidance on the development of extensions to
  <a href="http://vtk.org/">
   VTK
  </a>
  for multiscale spatiotemporal visualization.
 </p>
 <p>
  The European Union (EU) has funded 5 institutes to investigate and address challenges associated with mulitscale spatiotemporal visualization (MSV) as part of the  VPHOP/LHDL project.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to produce open-source extensions to VTK that support MSV and that can be incorporated into Slicer,

 <p>
  The EU’s MSV consortium wants your input in defining challenges and opportunities for MSV.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have a project with MSV components or would like to suggest challenges or solutions regarding MSV, we would like to hear from you.   Please respond to via email to Debora Testi (
  <a href="mailto:d.testi@scsolutions.it">
   d.testi@scsolutions.it
  </a>
  ).   Any email format is welcome, but it would be particularly helpful if you could provide the following:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   A short description of the problem being addressed, including the range of scales involved
  </li>
  <li>
   The sources/types of data as input;
  </li>
  <li>
   Existing visualizations and models being used;
  </li>
  <li>
   The expected outcome (e.g., data to be produced or hypothesis to be tested); and
  </li>
  <li>
   References to websites and/or publications that provide more information.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Furthermore, we welcome references to or the contribution of exemplary data that we and others can use in the development and testing of MSV solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  We understand that it can be difficult to find time to respond to surveys such as this one, but by contributing at this early stage you can help guide our efforts to produce solutions that fit your needs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thank you very much for your time and cooperation.  We look forward to hearing from you!
