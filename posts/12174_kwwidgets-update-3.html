  Although KWWidgets has been under development for quite some time, and some of the classes had been released as part of the ParaView distribution, the KWWidget project only recently became its own toolkit with an associated web site (
  <a href="http://www.kwwidgets.org">
   www.kwwidgets.org
  </a>
  ), mailing list, FAQ, and Wiki. Currently, the development code is available via CVS. Kitware intends to release the first official version of KWWidgets in conjunction with the release of VTK 5.2. Thereafter, KWWidgets releases will coincide with VTK releases.
