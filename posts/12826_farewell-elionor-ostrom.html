     As a true scientist, Ostrom was set apart from many Economics scholars by her interest and dedication for performing fieldwork. That is, actually going into the world and exploring how actual human institutions worked, instead of limiting herself to the thought experiments and small groups experiments that are characteristic of so many research endeavours in academia.
