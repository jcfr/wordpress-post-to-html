  A recent
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShbP3OpASA">
   interview with Linus Torvalds
  </a>
  made headlines for his
  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/18/linus-torvalds-nvidia-linux/">
   colorful comments
  </a>
  about the relationship between NVidia and the Linux Kernel community.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interview is full of great material that is well worth listening to:

  Here we capture some of the memorable quotes, particularly on what relates to the recipe that made the Linux Kernel community grow and mature to what it is today:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    People gravitate towards they are good at
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    It was all very organic
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Most of what happened in Linux development was very natural
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    The hierarchy we used for doing development, the fact that I worked with ten maintainers, roughly,… and they have their submaintainer …ten … that they trust…
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    How many people do you trust ?  … 10.
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
  On why the Linux Kernel community grew to it current scale:
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <em>
   “One of the reasons it works really well is because it grew,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   we didn’t try to enforce a certain hierarchy on it,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   we used the hierarchy that just work on its own,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and that turned out to be the right hierarchy.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This illustrates the counter-intuitive notion that in order to let a self-organizing system to evolve, one has to refrain from attempting to control it.
 </p>
 <p>
  When asked about the prospective longevity of the Kernel and whether it could survive without Linus Torvalds, he asked for a show of hands:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    How many of you are involved in an Open Source project that is not the Kernel ?
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    How many of you have a core team that is more than 10 people ?
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    The normal size for most open source projects is three people, roughly
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    In the Kernel we have 50 people that are really involved, and at every release we have a thousand people who are really involved, who send us patches.
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Why didn’t you continued at the university ?
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <em>
   “I love being at the university, but I hate writing papers.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Commenting on Social Effects of the Open Source Movement:
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  “
  <em>
   The openess of the Linux model have had some people stand up and think,
   <br/>
   how we can use this in our area.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <em>
   “I love the discussion a lot of scientists have about open publications.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  When asked about having a Vision:
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <em>
   “I believe more in having passion,
   <br/>
   I think really caring about what you do is way more important
   <br/>
   than having this vision about the golden future that you want to reach”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, a great interview that shows the human, pragmatic and unassuming character of Linus Torvalds.
