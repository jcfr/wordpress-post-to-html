  <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">
   The MICCAI Young Scientist Publication Impact Award is intended to recognize, reward, and encourage those scientists who are early in their careers and who are shaping the future of our field. This award is given in recognition of a MICCAI conference publication by a young scientist that was presented at the main MICCAI conference within the past five years and that has subsequently had a significant impact on the field.

   The award committee consisted of Dr. Sandy Wells (Brigham and Women’s Hospital / Harvard, Committee Chair), Dr. Marc Niethammer (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), and Dr. Stephen Aylward (Kitware). The committee considers qualitative measures such as a personal statement from the author as well as quantitative measures such as the number times the paper, and follow-on papers, have been cited.

 <p>
  <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">
   That paper addresses the visual interpretability of machine learning models by using latent semantics analysis. That paper is also one of the early applications of deep learning to histopathology images.
