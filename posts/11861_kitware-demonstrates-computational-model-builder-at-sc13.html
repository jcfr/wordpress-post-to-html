    The  Kitware Team is at Supercomputing 2013 this week demonstrating a  variety of scientific computing software solutions. Included in this  demonstration lineup is CMB-Hydro, which is part of the Computational  Model Builder (CMB) Open Source Project. CMB-Hydro is focused on  building hydrological simulations and is developed jointly by Kitware  and the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).  CMB-Hydro addresses the pre- and post-processing needs associated with  groundwater and surface water hydrological simulations, and includes  tools for processing scatter point data, creating geometric domains,  associating simulation information to parts of the domain, and creating  and manipulating computational meshes.

   In  this video example the subject of study is the Chesapeake Bay area.  Several simulations will be performed to study important regional issues  including the level of flooding that would be expected under certain  hurricane conditions and the impact of fertilizer run off in the  de-oxygenation of the bays. A high resolution digital elevation model is  available for the area, and this must be converted into polygonal data  for input into the simulation process. This conversion is performed  using a series of filters available in the CMB suite, as well as a  manual step distinguishing between the Chesapeake Bay (shown in green),  the Delaware Bay (shown in orange) and the off shore areaÂ  (shown in  blue).
