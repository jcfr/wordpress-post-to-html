  , today announced it is working with NVIDIA  to develop several powerful enhancements for the field of high  performance computing (HPC) visualization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among these is a new

  (VTK) rendering backend, which targets graphics processing units (GPUs)  and takes advantage of the flexible programmable pipelines available in  modern systems. This development has already resulted in significant  improvements in rendering performance, especially with large geometries  (20 million+ triangles) that can now be rendered over 100 times faster.

  “Through our collaboration with NVIDIA, we will enhance the  open-source VTK and ParaView to better serve the HPC visualization  community,” said

   XVis: Visualization for the Extreme-Scale Scientific-Computation Ecosystem
  </a>
  ,”  Kitware, in collaboration with government labs and academia, is  developing a unified visualization library, named VTK-m, as a single  point to collaborate, contribute, and leverage massively threaded  visualization algorithms. Kitware will be demonstrating VTK-m in NVIDIA  GPU-accelerated applications in in situ mode within ParaView Catalyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  NVIDIA will add future EGL support to its drivers, eliminating the  need to install an X server for graphics output in ParaView. The  companies are also exploring bringing OptiX parallel ray tracing and  volume visualization capabilities into ParaView for better insight into  simulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  This collaboration will enable VTK and ParaView to fully benefit from  the huge computational and graphics performance NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro  architectures provide.
