   ParaView 5.4 enriches the color legend and restores axes per dataset.

 <p>
  Kitware team members will call attention to ParaView 5.4 in a
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/events/isc-high-performance-2017/">
   workshop
  </a>
  at ISC High Performance 2017. The company timed the development cycle to acquaint conference registrants with release milestones:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Multi-block Inspector panel, through which users review and modify properties for blocks in hierarchical multi-block datasets, received a redesign with performance and usability in mind.
  </li>
  <li>
   The approach for loading state files in ParaView changed. The approach now allows ParaView to “
   <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/new-options-when-loading-paraview-state-files/">
    Search files under specified directory
   </a>
   .” This ability lets users share state files along with the datasets that these files need.
  </li>
  <li>
   Reformatted dialog boxes for saving screenshots and animations improved access to options that affect saved results, including color palette, background transparency and spacing between views.
  </li>
  <li>
   Axes Grid, a mechanism for annotating coordinate axes in three-dimensional views, extended to annotate each individual dataset.
  </li>
  <li>
   The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) file reader gained support for boundary condition patches for curvilinear grids and support for block selection according to family names.
  </li>
  <li>
   The number of supported VTK-m filters increased. Individually, these filters offer accelerated cell and point averaging, clipping, unused points removal and general surface extraction. In addition, the VTK-m contour filter acquired the ability to specify multiple isocontour values.
  </li>
  <li>
   Support improved for High Dots Per Inch (HiDPI) displays such as Retina.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="size-full wp-image-18426">
  “In the next release, ParaView 5.5, users can expect usability to continue to advance,” Ayachit said. “Specifically, the release will incorporate OSPRay path tracing for realistic lighting.”
