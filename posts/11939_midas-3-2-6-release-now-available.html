  The Midas team is pleased to announce the Midas 3.2.6 release. This release features security and stability improvements and other upgrades to enhance the Midas user experience.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The community descriptions functionality was enhanced and the upload workflow was streamlined. These two features are vital to Midas, and the updates provide a much better user experience. To further increase the user-friendliness of the system, the team added more batch move, merge, copy, and edit operations to folder views, as well as making the folder view sortable.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  For those interested in tailoring their Midas installations themselves, the Midas team added a plugin for landing pages and the ability to render Midas without the default layout. There is also new web-api functionality to download by hash.

  In the Midas 3.2.6 release there are a number of other changes and issues that have been resolved, and the full list is available in the
