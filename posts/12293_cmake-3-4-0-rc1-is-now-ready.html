 <p>
  Some of the more significant features of CMake 3.4 are:
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "if()" command learned a new "TEST" operator that evaluates to
  <br/>
  true if a given test name has been defined by the "add_test()"
  <br/>
  command.  See policy "CMP0064".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install(DIRECTORY)" command "DESTINATION" option learned to
  <br/>
  support "generator expressions".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install(FILES)" command "DESTINATION" option learned to
  <br/>
  support "generator expressions".
 </p>
 <p>
  * CMake learned to honor "*.manifest" source files with MSVC tools.
  <br/>
  Manifest files named as sources of ".exe" and ".dll" targets will be
  <br/>
  merged with linker-generated manifests and embedded in the binary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features:
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMakeExpandImportedTargets" module is now documented as
  <br/>
  deprecated.  See module documentation for an explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS" variable no longer has any effect.
  <br/>
  Previously it was partially implemented and unreliable.

   CMake 3.4 Release Notes
   <br/>
   ***********************
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Changes made since CMake 3.3 include the following.
 </p>
 <p>
  New Features
  <br/>
  ============
 </p>
 <p>
  Generators
  <br/>
  ———-
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Visual Studio 14 2015" generator learned to select a Windows
  <br/>
  10 SDK based on the value of the "CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION" variable and
  <br/>
  the SDKs available on the host.
 </p>
 <p>
  * CMake learned rudimentary support for the Apple Swift language.
  <br/>
  When using the "Xcode" generator with Xcode 6.1 or higher, one may
  <br/>
  enable the "Swift" language with the "enable_language()" command or
  <br/>
  the "project()" command (this is an error with other generators or
  <br/>
  when Xcode is too old).  Then one may list ".swift" source files in
  <br/>
  targets for compilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Commands
  <br/>
  ——–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "find_program()" command learned a "NAMES_PER_DIR" option to
  <br/>
  consider all given "NAMES" in each directory before moving on to the
  <br/>
  next directory.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "get_filename_component()" command learned a new "BASE_DIR"
  <br/>
  subcommand.  This is used to specify a base directory when
  <br/>
  calculating an absolute path from a relative path.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "if()" command learned a new "TEST" operator that evaluates to
  <br/>
  true if a given test name has been defined by the "add_test()"
  <br/>
  command.  See policy "CMP0064".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install(DIRECTORY)" command "DESTINATION" option learned to
  <br/>
  support "generator expressions".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install(FILES)" command "DESTINATION" option learned to
  <br/>
  support "generator expressions".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "string()" command learned a new "APPEND" subcommand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Variables
  <br/>
  ———
 </p>
 <p>
  * The Makefile Generators and the "Ninja" generator learned to add
  <br/>
  compiler launcher tools like distcc and ccache along with the
  <br/>
  compiler for "C" and "CXX" languages.  See the
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER" variable and
  <br/>
  "&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER" target property for details.
 </p>
 <p>
  * New "CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC" and
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC" variables were introduced to
  <br/>
  initialize the "LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC" and
  <br/>
  "LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC" target properties, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Properties
  <br/>
  ———-
 </p>
 <p>
  * Visual Studio Generators learned to support additonal target
  <br/>
  properties to customize projects for NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual
  <br/>
  Studio Edition:
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_ARCH"
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_PROGUARD"
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  * "ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ANDROID_STL_TYPE"
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", and
  <br/>
  "RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" target properties learned to support
  <br/>
  "generator expressions".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "SOURCE_DIR" and "BINARY_DIR" target properties were
  <br/>
  introduced to allow project code to query where a target is defined.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "OUTPUT_NAME" target property and its variants learned to
  <br/>
  support "generator expressions".
 </p>
 <p>
  * A "TARGET_MESSAGES" global property was added to tell the Makefile
  <br/>
  Generators whether to generate commands to print output after each
  <br/>
  target is completed.
 </p>
 <p>
  * On Windows with MS-compatible tools, CMake learned to optionally
  <br/>
  generate a module definition (".def") file for "SHARED" libraries.
  <br/>
  See the "WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS" target property.
 </p>
 <p>
  Modules
  <br/>
  ——-
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module "ExternalProject_Add()" function
  <br/>
  "GIT_SUBMODULES" option now also limits the set of submodules that
  <br/>
  are initialized in addition to the prior behavior of limiting the
  <br/>
  set of submodules that are updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module learned new "USES_TERMINAL" arguments
  <br/>
  for giving steps exclusive terminal access.  This is useful with the
  <br/>
  "Ninja" generator to monitor CMake superbuild progress and prevent
  <br/>
  CPU oversubscription.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindBISON" module "BISON_TARGET" macro learned a new
  <br/>
  "DEFINES_FILE" option to specify a custom output header to be
  <br/>
  generated.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindHDF5" module learend a new "HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL" option
  <br/>
  allowing users to specify that a parallel HDF5 tool is preferred if
  <br/>
  both are available.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindIce" module now provides imported targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindJava" module learned to optionally find the "idlj" and
  <br/>
  "jarsigner" tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindOpenSSL" module now provides imported targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindOpenSSL" module learned a new "OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS"
  <br/>
  option to search only for static libraries.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindPkgConfig" learned a new "pkg_get_variable()" command
  <br/>
  which may be used to query for arbitrary variables from a package
  <br/>
  (such as for related tools or data and plugin install paths).
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindProtobuf" module gained a new
  <br/>
  "protobuf_generate_python()" function to generate python sources
  <br/>
  from ".proto" files.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindTIFF" module learned to search separately for debug and
  <br/>
  release variants.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindwxWidgets" module learned to support version requests.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindXercesC" module learned to search separately for debug
  <br/>
  and release variants.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindZLIB" module learned to search separately for debug and
  <br/>
  release variants.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "GNUInstallDirs" module learned special default values for
  <br/>
  certain installation prefixes according to the GNU Coding Standards
  <br/>
  and the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "UseJava" module "add_jar" function learned to support
  <br/>
  response files (e.g. "@srcs.txt") for source specification.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "UseJava" module "install_jar" function learned new
  <br/>
  "DESTINATION" and "COMPONENT" options to specify the corresponding
  <br/>
  "install()" command options.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "UseJava" module gained a new "create_javah" function to
  <br/>
  create C headers from Java classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generator Expressions
  <br/>
  ———————
 </p>
 <p>
  * A new "$&lt;SHELL_PATH:…&gt;" "generator expression" has been added.
 </p>
 <p>
  CTest
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * CTest learned to optionally measure the CPU load during parallel
  <br/>
  testing and avoid starting tests that may cause the load to exceed a
  <br/>
  given threshold.  See the "ctest(1)" command "–test-load" option,
  <br/>
  the "TestLoad" setting of the CTest Test Step, the "CTEST_TEST_LOAD"
  <br/>
  variable, and the "TEST_LOAD" option of the "ctest_test()" command.
 </p>
 <p>
  * "ctest(1)" learned options "–test-output-size-passed" and "–
  <br/>
  test- output-size-failed" to customize the limit on test output size
  <br/>
  submitted when running as a Dashboard Client.
 </p>
 <p>
  CPack
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackDeb" module learned to set package dependencies per
  <br/>
  component.  See variables:
 </p>
 <p>
  * "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_BREAKS"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS"

 <p>
  * "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_PROVIDES"
 </p>
 <p>
  * "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS"
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  * "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS"
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPack" module learned to package empty directories.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPack" module gained a new setting,
  <br/>
  "CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES", which can be used to ensure the cpack
  <br/>
  program receives the settings' values exactly as they were set, even
  <br/>
  if they contain CMake-special characters. For compatibility, it's
  <br/>
  off by default.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Compile Features" functionality is now aware of features
  <br/>
  supported by GNU C compilers on Windows.
 </p>
 <p>
  * CMake learned to honor "*.manifest" source files with MSVC tools.
  <br/>
  Manifest files named as sources of ".exe" and ".dll" targets will be
  <br/>
  merged with linker-generated manifests and embedded in the binary.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The Concurrent Fortran 77 compiler is now supported. Its "compiler
  <br/>
  id" is "CCur".
 </p>
 <p>
  * "cmake(1)" gained a new "–trace-expand" command line option that
  <br/>
  is like "–trace" but expands variable references in the output.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features
  <br/>
  ===============================
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMakeExpandImportedTargets" module is now documented as
  <br/>
  deprecated.  See module documentation for an explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS" variable no longer has any effect.
  <br/>
  Previously it was partially implemented and unreliable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other Changes
  <br/>
  =============
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CheckFunctionExists", "CheckLibraryExists",
  <br/>
  "CheckSymbolExists", and "FindThreads" modules learned to work in
  <br/>
  environments where only CXX is enabled.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackDeb" module now correctly excludes symlinks during
  <br/>
  package checksum calculation.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackDeb" no longer uses fakeroot and system tar program for
  <br/>
  packaging.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPack" module no longer mangles settings with CMake-special
  <br/>
  characters when they're used as defaults for other settings. The
  <br/>
  macro "cpack_set_if_not_set", which was responsible for this, is now
  <br/>
  deprecated.
 </p>
 <p>
  * CMake no longer links executables with flags to export symbols
  <br/>
  unless the "ENABLE_EXPORTS" target property is set. See policy
  <br/>
  "CMP0065".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "SONAME" field is no longer set for "MODULE" libraries created
  <br/>
  with the "add_library()" command.  "MODULE" libraries are meant for
  <br/>
  explicit dynamic loading at runtime. They cannot be linked so
  <br/>
  "SONAME" is not useful.
