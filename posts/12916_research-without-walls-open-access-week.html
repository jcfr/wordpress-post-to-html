  The exercise is simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ask yourself:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Why do you Publish ?
  </li>
  <li>
   Why did you choose Research as a Profession ?
  </li>
  <li>
   Is it because you want to restrict the public access to information ?
  </li>
  <li>
   Why to collaborate with those who do not collaborate with you ?
  </li>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Why to give your labor for free to those who will not
    <br/>
    freely share back information with you ?
   </li>
  </ul>
