  , assistant director of computer vision, will grant insight into support of squad-level activities from Kitware with contributions to unmanned systems, sensors and computer vision software. He will discuss the intelligent integration of various platforms, sensors, software and humans to demonstrate the techniques, challenges and value that intelligent integration provides. The brief will occur Monday, May 8, 2017, from 4:30 to 5 p.m. CDT in room C140 of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas.

  “Currently, our warfighters at the squad level do not have the tactical advantages available at the brigade level,” Fieldhouse said. “We are developing capabilities to give squads extra sets of eyes on the ground and in the sky to provide actionable intel in real time without overloading warfighters with additional data.”
