  To share our latest developments in exascale visualization, we are pleased to announce that we will once again be part of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, better known as Supercomputing (SC). SC15 will be held in Austin, Texas, from November 15 to November 20, 2015.

  (VTK),
  <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">
   ParaView

  ), which will feature cutting-edge software solutions, giveaways, and experts on-hand for discussion. We will also host presentations from team members and collaborators at our booth on topics including VTK-m; software-defined visualization; visualization of electron flow at the nanoscale; an open-source, image-based approach to extreme-scale data analysis; generating nuclear reactor core models using

  During the main conference, we will showcase our work in a number of activities. On Sunday, from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm,
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/dave-demarle/">
   Mr. Dave DeMarle
  </a>
  will join collaborators in highlighting “Large Scale Visualization with ParaView” in Room 13AB. This hands-on tutorial will provide an overview of ParaView and how it can be implemented for scientific visualization.

  On Monday, from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm,
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/andrew-bauer/">
   Dr. Andrew Bauer
  </a>
  will co-present a tutorial titled “Getting Started with In Situ Analysis and Visualization Using ParaView Catalyst” in Room 12B.
  <a href="http://www.paraview.org/in-situ/">
   ParaView Catalyst
  </a>
  is a lightweight version of the ParaView server library that is designed to be easily integrated into large-scale numerical code to perform in situ analysis at run time. Dr. Bauer will also present a paper and a lightning talk at the First Workshop on In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV2015), detailing ParaView Catalyst and its coupling with Helicopter Overset Simulations (Helios).

 <p class="responsiveNews">
  On Wednesday at 1:30 pm,
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/patrick-oleary/">
   Dr. Patrick O’Leary
  </a>
  will shed light on “Responsive Large Data Analysis and Visualization with the ParaView Ecosystem” at NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Theater at booth #1021. Then, on Friday, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm in Room 16AB, Dr. O’Leary will serve as a panelist on “In Situ Methods: Hype or Necessity?” The panel will discuss the utility of in situ methods and how they fit in the current supercomputing landscape.

  In addition to showcasing its expertise at the conference, we will take part in the Intel Fellow Traveler tours and the
  <a href="http://sc15.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail?evid=pec105">
   Mentor-Protégé Program
  </a>
  . We will also actively recruit at the SC15
  <a href="http://sc15.supercomputing.org/conference-program/studentssc/student-postdoc-job-opportunity-fair">
   Student-Postdoc Job &amp; Opportunity Fair
  </a>
  on Wednesday from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. Beyond the fair, interested candidates can visit our booth to learn more about career opportunities.

  In conjunction with SC15, we will take part in the Intel HPC Developer Conference. On Sunday, November 15th, at 1:30 pm, Mr. DeMarle will talk about “Speed and Beauty: ParaView Enhanced by Intel Software Defined Visualization” at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. Mr. DeMarle will later be part of a panel session on code modernization that will be held on Thursday, November 19th, at the Intel Community Hub. There, he will explain our work on vtkSMP and VTK-m, as well as on integrating OpenGL2, OpenSWR, and OSPRay rendering into VTK and ParaView.
