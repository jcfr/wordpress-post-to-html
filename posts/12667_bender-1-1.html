  Bender is an open-source toolkit based on 3D Slicer that provides algorithms and a user-friendly application for rigging, skinning, posing, and volume resampling, enabling researchers to interactively reposition an anatomic labelmap into a desired pose.

  This release features a number of enhancements, notably bringing usability improvements over
