   Clare Sutcliff
  </a>
  raises awareness about the importance of teaching children how to write code, and what its being done in the UK to achieve this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clare shares results from a survey of 1,300 computer programmers, that revealed
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   69% started to write code before the age of 14
  </li>
  <li>
   62% got started by the excitment of:
   <em>
    making things
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  We refer to the current generation as
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">
   Digital Natives
  </a>
  . They were were born with ubiquitous Internet connectivity, mobile devices, and tablets as their first toys.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since the beginning of the millennium, the members of this young generation, although they carry highly powerful mobile devices,
  <strong>
   they do not know how to program them
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  They are
  <strong>
   Consumers
  </strong>
  not
  <strong>
   Producers
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  Clare refers to them as the
  <strong>
   Lost Generation
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Some countries are reacting to this reality, for example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In Scotland, children begin learning to program from age 3.
  </li>
  <li>
   In Stonia, children from age 6 to 18 will learn to program as part of the national curriculum.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Part of the challenge, is that teachers, do not know how to code either.
 </p>
 <p>
  To solve that cycle, Clare, on her side, initiated a project in which they engaged professional computer programmers to go to local schools and teach kids how to program. They do this in after-school clubs, in an unstructured and fun environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  As platform they adopted the
  <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">
   Scratch
  </a>
  language, that was developed at MIT with this very purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were hoping to have 20 clubs by the end of the yearâ€¦.
  <br/>
  but they actually have 300+ clubs in the UK.
 </p>
 <p>
  With about 15 children on every club, this is about 4,500 children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much still remains to be done:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   There are
   <strong>
    23,000
   </strong>
   schools in the UK,
  </li>
  <li>
   but there are also
   <strong>
    323,000
   </strong>
   software professionals in the UKâ€¦ Â Â  Â  ðŸ™‚
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  One day, these new
  <strong>
   Literate Digital Natives
  </strong>
  will grow upâ€¦
 </p>
 <p>
  and then they will teach the next generation to code.
