  Kitware, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has established a Chapel Hill, North Carolina office. The Chapel Hill office will be led by Dr. Stephen Aylward, Chief Medical Scientist, and Julien Jomier, a member of Kitware’s research staff. The role of the Chapel Hill office will be to extend the company’s ties to the medical research community, and to support current efforts in medical image processing.

  Previous to establishing Kitware’s Chapel Hill office, Dr. Stephen Aylward was director of the CADDLab as a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Radiology at UNC. The CADDLab is the Image Processing Core Facility for the School of Medicine and a component of the Small Animal Imaging Core for UNC’s Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Research Center. Additionally, Dr. Aylward serves as President of the Insight Software Consortium and as an Associated Editor of IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.

 <p>
  Under Dr. Aylward’s direction, the CADDLab has a history of successful collaborations with Kitware. The CADDLab has worked with Kitware on the development of the NLM’s Insight Toolkit (ITK), a histological atlas application, and Georgetown University’s Image Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK). The CADDLab also worked closely with Kitware to co-develop the Insight Journal. For many of these and other projects, Julien Jomier has been the lead developer in the CADDLab. He too will be moving from the CADDLab to Kitware’s Chapel Hill office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware’s new office in Chapel Hill will build upon its solid foundation in medical image analysis. Julien Jomier and Dr. Aylward will continue to work with Drs. Bullitt, Gerig, Pisano, Pizer and others at UNC. Additionally, Stephen and Julien will work with other Kitware experts including Will Schroeder, Rick Avila and Luis Ibanez to pursue new areas of clinical research and product development, centered on Kitware’s VolView platform.
