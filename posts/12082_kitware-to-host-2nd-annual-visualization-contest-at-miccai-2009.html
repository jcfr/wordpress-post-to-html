  , the 12th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, which will be held in London from September 20-24.

  The contest, which is open to the public, is being hosted at:
  <a href="http://public.kitware.com/ImageVote/" target="_blank">
   public.kitware.com/ImageVote
  </a>
  . Users may submit visualizations and cast votes after registering, for free, at the contest website. Visualizations may be charts, graphs, photographs, or renderings from the biomedical field.
 </p>
 <p>
  <p>
   All images must have been produced by programs that use ITK and/or VTK. To that effect we’ve generated a list of applications on the
   <a href="http://public.kitware.com/ImageVote/" target="_blank">
    contest website
   </a>
   and kitware.com which use ITK and VTK and are therefore eligible.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have enlisted a panel of expert judges to help determine the winners. Entries will be judged based on scientific significance, aesthetics, and use of ITK or VTK. The winners will be announced during the conference’s awards session.
  </p>
  <p>
   • First-place prize is $750 and a Kitware shirt or hat.
   <br/>
   • Second-place prize is $250 and a Kitware shirt or hat.
