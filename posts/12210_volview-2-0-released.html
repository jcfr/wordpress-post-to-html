  Through an initiative with the National Library of Medicine, VolView has harnessed the power of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) for advanced image processing algorithms. Many techniques are available in this release of VolView, with more expected through the involvement of the ITK community. Filters are accessed from VolView through a public filter “plugin” API that allows developers to employ their latest image processing techniques from within a powerful visualization system.  The VolView filter plugin functionality has many benefits: it allows access to ITK functionality for non-programmers, it creates a vehicle for sharing and comparing segmentation techniques, and it serves as a visual debugger for algorithm developers.
 </p>
 <p>
  VolView 2.0 is offered in two versions: Free Mode and Professional Mode. In Free Mode, VolView has full visualization and image processing capabilities. In Professional Mode, additional functionality such as data annotation, collaboration, animation, lightbox, and oblique probing are available. A 30-day trial of VolView 2.0 Professional Mode is provided, which will revert to Free Mode after the trial period expires.
 </p>

  More information on VolView can be obtained by visiting the VolView web site (ref), sending email to kitware@kitware.com, or calling 1-518-371-3971. VolView 2.0 is currently available on Windows platforms. Linux and Mac OSX releases are expected in early 2004.
