  The Insight Toolkit (
  <a href="http://www.itk.org">
   ITK
  </a>
  ) will be going through a refactoring process this year. The main goals of the refactoring process are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Revise
  </li>
  <li>
   Simplify
  </li>
  <li>
   Accelerate
  </li>
  <li>
   Improve DICOM support
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In order to address these challenges, the
  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">
   National Library of Medicine
  </a>
  has put together a team of six contractors that will be collaborating in refactoring ITK. This new version of ITK will be in the 4.0 series and we refer to it simply as
  <a href="http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4.0">
   ITKv4
  </a>
  . The release of
  <a href="http://itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html">
   ITK 3.20
  </a>
  will be the stable and reliable release offered to users during the time that ITKv4 is being developed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this refactoring, ITK will be improving its support for domain fields beyond radiology. In particular, we will be working closely with application developers in the fields of:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Microscopy
  </li>
  <li>
   Remote Sensing
  </li>
  <li>
   Computer Vision
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Providing better support for these domains will require the need to introduce changes and improvements in ITK for fundamental features such as:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Support for very large images (larger than 4 Gigabytes)
  </li>
  <li>
   Support for muti-channel images
  </li>
  <li>
   Additional File Formats (LSM, TIFF variations,
   <a href="http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Proposals:JPEG_2000_ImageIO">
    JPEG2000
   </a>
   , among others)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Information about the modifications to ITK will be disseminated following the “
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">
   Release Early, Release Often
  </a>
  ” golden rule of Open Source software development.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have started with an initial clean up of the toolkit, following the migration plan described in:
  <br/>
  <a href="http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/Migration_Plan">
   http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/Migration_Plan
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  and schematically described here:

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  As you can see, one of the first steps, have been to move from CVS to
  <a href="http://git-scm.com/">
   Git
  </a>
  . You can now clone ITK by following these instructions:
  <a href="http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Git">

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are looking forward to working with the larger community of ITK users to make sure that ITKv4 is a useful and powerful resource for many different applications.
