   announced
  </a>
  the release of ITK 4.9 on behalf the
  <a href="http://itk.org/">
   Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
  </a>
  (ITK) community.
 </p>
 <p>
  The international community around the open-source, cross-platform system for image analysis has grown substantially since development began in 1999. Today, ITK has
  <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/itk/contributors?sort=latest_commit&amp;time_span=12+months">
   over 60 active developers
  </a>
  . These developers and others have made over
  <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/itk">
   49 thousand commits and added more than 1.7 million lines of code
  </a>
  . According to
  <a href="http://openhub.net">
   openhub.net
  </a>
  , this amounts to approximately 494 years of effort! What is more, the releases of the project have been

   About ITK
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers from around the world with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis. Through extreme programming methodologies, ITK delivers leading-edge algorithms for processing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, positron emission tomography (PET), fluoroscopy, and microscopy data.
 </p>
 <p>
  ITK began with a contract for the development of an open-source registration and segmentation toolkit from the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). Dr. Terry Yoo, the Project Manager at the NLM, organized the six main contractors that comprised the Insight Software Consortium: GE Corporate R&amp;D; Kitware, Inc.; MathSoft (now known as Insightful); the University of North Carolina; the University of Tennessee; and the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Yoo’s aim for the ITK project was to create a repository of fundamental algorithms that would form the basis of future research in the areas of medical image registration and segmentation. He also sought to grow a self-sustaining community around the toolkit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, ITK’s funding comes predominantly from the NLM and has been supplemented with funding from other institutes from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defence (Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center), and a variety of commercial development contracts.
