    Kitware and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) were awarded a Phase II SBIR by the Department of Energy to develop collaborative visualization tools for large-scale data. The proposed work will address the typical problems faced by geographically and organizationally separated research and engineering teams, who produce large data and wish to work together to analyze and understand that data.
