  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   is pleased to announce the development of an
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   open-source website that depicts a network of participants in the popular Ice Bucket Challenge,
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   which has raised funds for The ALS Association. We all have seen the
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   unending stream of news reports of celebrities performing the ALS
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   Ice Bucket Challenge. However, no one report has captured the true scale and proliferation of the challenge
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   or highlighted the interesting connections between the participants.
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   Accordingly, some folks in our Scientific Computing team created a simple open-source
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   <a href="http://infovis.kitware.com/ice-bucket/">
    website
   </a>
   on the Ice Bucket Challenge to show the breadth of participation in the fundraiser. The
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   information visualization on the website also addresses how and why particular people
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   became involved in the challenge by linking participants to those who challenged them, as well
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   as to those who they, in turn, challenged. For example, below you can see that at least four separate celebrities challenged Oprah, and that Oprah challenged Steven Spielberg.

 </p>
 <p>
  For the website, a simple data format was developed that is read by the site to list the participants
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   in a grid, show details and related individuals, and link to posted videos of participants taking the
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   challenge.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   To further promote community involvement, we are encouraging additions and corrections to
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   the website from anyone who would like to participate.
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   Those who would like to add or propose corrections to the website can submit information
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   through the
   <a href="https://github.com/tangelo-hub/icebucket/issues/new">
    issues page
   </a>
   . For the developer-inclined, Kitware urges others to fork its
   <a href="https://github.com/tangelo-hub/icebucket">
    repository
   </a>
   on
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   GitHub and submit pull requests with additions to its JSON data file and image thumbnails.
