   “Murmurations”

 </p>
 <p>
  The images of Murmurations were so mesmerizing, that Tapscott’s voice got lost in the background, while we witnessed what is clear evidence of a profound operating principle of the Universe:

 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">
   <em>
    “The emergence of complex behaviour in leaderless environments”
   </em>

 </p>
 <p>
  In this particular case,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling">
   Starlings
  </a>
  joins in groups composed of hundreds-of-thousands of individuals, and in the absence of centralized control and devoid of a social hierarchical structure, display behaviours can easily be interpreted as those of a macro-organism whose cells are the individual birds.
 </p>
 <p>
  See in particular, at [0:55] of the video above, how the macro-group evolves protrusions that attack a predator bird, which is much larger than any of the individual Starlings, but that becomes minuscule compared to the macro-group.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempts at modelling and understanding this type of group behaviour have been made, for example in this article:
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href='"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/26/11865.abstract'>
   “Scale-Free Correlations in Starling Flocks”
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is available, as all other
  <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">
   Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,
  </a>
  as an Open Access paper.

 <p style="text-align: center;">

  This last video below could easily be entitled:
  <br/>
  <span style="font-size: small;">
   <em>

     “Murmuration versus Predator”
    </a>
   </em>
  </span>
  <br/>
  and should lead us to question everything we think we know about organizations,
  <br/>
  and the effectiveness of command and control structures.

 <p style="text-align: center;">
  There is something in a Murmuration that is reminiscent of the behavioural power of Open Source communities.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  Something that reminds us that:
