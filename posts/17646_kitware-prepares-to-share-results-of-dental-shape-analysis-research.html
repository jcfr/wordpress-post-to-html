  Kitware detailed plans to share preliminary results of ongoing research at the 95th General Session &amp; Exhibition of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR). Kitware Technical Leader
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/beatriz-paniagua/">
   Beatriz Paniagua

  , Ph.D., will present the results in “Continuous 4D Shape Analysis of Mandibular Changes” at an oral session on temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD). The session, TMD Imaging Advances in Craniofacial Biology and Orthodontics, will take place Friday, March 24, 2017, in Moscone West in San Francisco, California.

  The research that Paniagua will present aims to help dental scientists characterize the type of structural changes that result in the mandible from orthognathic surgery. This research showcases an example application of shape regression that Kitware and team members plan to incorporate into an open-source software framework in a multi-year initiative. The initiative began in December 2016, when the National Institutes of Health awarded the team with a Research Project (R01) grant. Since this time, team members have worked to integrate existing shape analysis research code into the framework, which they named Slicer Shape AnaLysis Toolbox (SlicerSALT). Once completed, SlicerSALT will become available as a customized version of

  .

  “SlicerSALT will allow researchers who may not have expertise in shape analysis to evaluate the geometrical properties of different three-dimensional anatomical structures,” Paniagua said. “Our team’s results demonstrate the usability of SlicerSALT to characterize postsurgical conditions such as temporomandibular joint resorption.”

  Paniagua will present during the 2:30 to 2:45 p.m. PST time slot. She will also participate in the Using CBCT for Measuring Temporo-Mandibular Joint Changes and Tooth Movement workshop, which will occur Saturday, March 25, 2017, from 2 to 3:30 p.m. PST.
