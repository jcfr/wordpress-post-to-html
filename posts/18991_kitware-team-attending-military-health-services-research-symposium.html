  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   on August 27-30, 2017. The Kitware team will attend to support our efforts and explore collaborations in physiology modeling, surgical simulation, dental and craniomaxillo facial injury, and traumatic brain injury. Dr. Clipp will present a paper she has co-authored, titled “On the TBI Initiated Restructuring of Cerebral Microvasculature: A Multi-Fidelity Modeling Approach” (Poster Session 1 on August 28, 2017).

   As part of surgical simulation effort, Kitware is developing virtual training platforms for abdominal laparoscopic surgical  procedures, and craniomaxillo facial and oral surgery.

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Kitware believes that careful, quantitative surgical planning can improve surgical outcomes and aid reducing the number of surgeries needed to heal warriors who have catastrophic face traumatic injuries. Reconstructive surgery in the cranial and maxillofacial (CMF) region is technically challenging and its outcome has great impact on the patient’s quality of life. Surgical procedures to correct CMF trauma injuries are extremely complex and patient specific, and they require careful planning and precise execution. The CMF team at Kitware has extensive expertise in 3D imaging and morphometric quantification that can aid

    Novel Ultrasound Processing Methods for Traumatic Brain Injury

   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    work
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   builds upon extensive clinical research that has shown that ultrasound imaging of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) can be used to quantify elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) as an indicator of TBI. We have devised computer-augmented point-of-care ultrasound system that simplifies the acquisition and automates the analysis of optic nerve ultrasound data using a low-cost, rugged, portable ultrasound probe with embedded machine learning algorithms and an instructional display. The system is intended for users with limited ultrasound experience, and provides probe guidance instructions and diagnostic results on its display. It does not show,  nor require the user to interpret potentially confusing b-mode images. Preliminary studies involving eye phantoms and retrospective analysis of clinical images indicates that our system will enable emergency medical service personnel with limited training to perform TBI assessment at the level of an expert ultrasonographer.
