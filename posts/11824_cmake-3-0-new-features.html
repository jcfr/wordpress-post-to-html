  We are pleased to announce the release of
  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.0/?C=M;O=D">
   CMake 3.0.0
  </a>
  . In CMake 3.0, the
  <a href="http://cmake.org/">
   CMake
  </a>
  language has been extended with *Bracket Argument* and *Bracket Comment* syntax inspired by Lua long bracket, and the CMake documentation has been converted to reStructuredText.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, new “CodeLite” and “Kate” extra generators are available for use with the Makefile or Ninja generators. In addition, the “add_library()” command learned a new “INTERFACE” library type, the “export()” command learned a new “EXPORT” mode that retrieves   the  list of targets to export from an export set configured by the    “install(TARGETS)” command “EXPORT” option, and the “project()” command learned to set some version variables to    values specified by the new “VERSION” option or to empty strings.
 </p>
