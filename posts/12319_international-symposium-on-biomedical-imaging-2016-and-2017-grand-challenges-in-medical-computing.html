  The
  <a href="http://biomedicalimaging.org/2016/">
   International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2016
  </a>
  and ISBI 2017 conferences are soliciting proposals for scientific challenges. The aim of the challenges is to accelerate the pace of research by providing quantitative comparisons of competing approaches to relevant problems, using standardized datasets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each challenge needs an organizing team responsible for providing training and test data, defining the tasks, specifying the metrics used to measure performance, managing entries, and conducting the studies and on-site presentations. ISBI will assist in advertising challenges, but the organizing team is ultimately responsible for challenge participation and success.
 </p>
 <p>
  The format of each challenge will be determined by the challenge organizers. We strongly encourage on-site evaluations and scientific presentations by challenge participants. We also encourage the investigation of alternative formats for hosting grand challenges, challenges that address machine learning and other base technologies as well as challenges that address end-user applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike previous years, we offer the opportunity to submit a proposal for challenges that span ISBI 2016 and ISBI 2017.  Proposals that include challenges for the two consecutive ISBIs could feature, for example, repeating a challenge to track how the field has advanced or addressing different stages in a data processing pipeline. Another possibility would be that in the first edition, the participants are encouraged to make their solutions available as open source software, and in the second event, the task remains the same but more data will be available, possibly made available through a joint effort of participants and organizers, and participants of the second edition can build upon the open source solutions from the prior edition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Challenges for ISBI 2016 are scheduled for the first and last day of ISBI, April 13 or April 16, 2016, at the Clarion Congress Hotel, in Prague, Czech Republic. The events will run for half a day.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Call for Data
 </h3>
 <p>
  In addition to this Call for Challenges we organize a Call for Data for all challenges of ISBI 2016 and 2017. Organizers are encouraged to be actively involved in these calls and include their ideas on this issue in their proposal. We would appreciate inclusion of contributed data in their challenge training and test data, to make the challenge data more diverse and more representative of data that would have to be processed by algorithms in a real world scenario.  As mentioned previously, these calls for data can take advantage of the multi-year challenge format.
