    IGSTK User Group Meeting
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  In February the sixth annual IGSTK user group meeting was held in conjunction with SPIE Medical Imaging in San Diego, CA. This meeting is an opportunity for the IGSTK user and developer communities to come together and discuss updates on the toolkit and its use in the field. One of the highlights of the meeting this year was the new breakout session to gather community input and feedback on the toolkit. Participants were broken into smaller working groups to answer several questions pressing on the IGSTK team. Responses were then consolidated into a summary for three areas: new features, biggest hurdles and project promotion ideas. The full list can be seen on the Kitware blog, and to continue the discussion, please send feedback to the IGSTK mailing list.

     American Football Plays Paper Presented
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  In January, Eran Swears presented a paper at the WACV conference in Breckenridge Colorado entitled:  Learning and Recognizing Complex Multi-Agent Activities with Applications to American Football Plays. The paper, authored by Eran Swears and Anthony Hoogs, will be published in the Workshop IEEE Publication.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic research, which stems from the DARPA CARVE program, seeks to determine if pre-planned or scripted coordinated activities can be automatically detected using automatically computed and highly fragmented tracks from video. American football was chosen as a surrogate problem domain as it shares many of the difficulties of reconnaissance video, including difficult tracking, interacting agents (players), high variability within the same play type, and active deception.
 </p>
 <p>
  The approach pushes the model complexity onto the observations by using a multi-variate kernel density while maintaining a simple HMM model. Temporal interactions of objects are captured by coupling the kernel observation distributions with a time-varying state-transition matrix, producing a Non-Stationary Kernel HMM (NSK-HMM). This modeling philosophy specifically addresses several issues that plague the more complex stationary models with simple observations, i.e. Dynamic Multi-Linked HMM (DML-HMM) and the Time-Delayed Probabilistic Graphical Model (TDPGM).  These include: smaller training datasets, sensitivity to intra class variability and/or dense uninformative clutter tracks. Experiments are performed in the American football video domain, where the offensive plays are the activities. Comparisons are made to the DML-HMM and an extension of the TDPGM to DBNs (TDDBN). The NSK-HMM achieves a 57.7% classification accuracy across seven activities, while the DML-HMM is 26.7% and the TDDBN is 21.3%.  When tested on four activities the NSK-HMM achieves a 76.0% accuracy.

     ParaView &amp; Atmospheric Climate Modeling
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  <br/>
  Kitware participated in the development of the animation “NSF/DOE Community Atmospheric Model: Total Precipitable Water” for the Climate Science Computational End Station (CCES). The video shows results from a CAM simulation that was run at Argonne National Laboratory. This research was recently presented as part of the keynote address at the 92nd American Meteorological Society Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 </p>
 <p>
  The animation of the simulation results was created by Joseph Insley of Argonne, with help from Kitware’s Andy Bauer,  using ParaView. This research project is being conducted by a collaborative group from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Sandia National Laboratories, Argonne National Laboratory, and Kitware.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to model such a complex system, the simulation code required 25 million core hours across 64,000 cores of Blue Gene/P, Intrepid, producing 0.25 simulated-years-per-day. The video depicts two months of the 27 month-long simulation. Using both the CAM5 physics and the highly-scalable spectral element dynamical core, this simulation of total precipitable water clearly shows developing hurricanes in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
 </p>
 <p>
  This research is important to the CCES, which aims to predict future climates by using scenarios of anthropogenic emissions and other changes resulting from U.S. energy policy decisions. It will be used to improve the scientific basis, accuracy and fidelity of climate models to address their impact on national policy.
