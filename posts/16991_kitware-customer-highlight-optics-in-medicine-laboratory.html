  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   The Optics in Medicine Laboratory at Dartmouth University studies aspects of tissue spectroscopy and imaging using both visible and near-infrared light.  The imaging technologies they develop are used to model various cancers of the breast, pancreas, brain, and bone.  They also examine the use of photodynamic therapy – a non-invasive medical procedure that uses photo-activated drugs to target tumors – in cancer treatment, and research how this treatment method can be combined with other types of cancer treatments to maximize the effectiveness of therapy regimens. The lab is comprised of researchers based at the

   The Optics in Medicine Laboratory has applied numerous technological developments to clinical problems in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of breast cancer, including investigating the relationships between pathological and optical imaging biomarkers of disease and relating these signatures to the presence of cancer as well as combining diffuse optical imaging with breast MRI to recover/exploit the function/molecular information available in the optical signals.  These successful efforts have been dependent on the

  Need: Why Dartmouth scientists came to Kitware
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   NIRFAST is an open-source MATLAB library developed by researchers in the Optics in Medicine Lab for modeling near-infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) light propagation and recovering volumetric images of optical biomarkers in tissue with a specific focus on diffusion modeling and reconstruction.  Dartmouth initially came to Kitware because they needed software to generate 3D models from medical images which could then be used by NIRFAST. This lead to the development of NIRView, a customized version of VolView to visualize and segment 3D medical images, like detailed in the blog post
   <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/open-source-tools-for-fast-segmentation-and-3d-volume-mesh-creation-from-medical-images-for-tissue-optics/">

 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Due to a need for more advanced image analysis and visualization capabilities resulting from NIRFAST’s expanding user base, NIRView was deprecated in favor of

   The figure below shows an example of the NIRFASTSlicer workflow.  NIRFASTSlicer allows for an image to be rendered and a region of interest identified (top left), the placement of landmarks identifying light sources and detectors (top right), multi-label segmentation and visualization of surface models (bottom left), and overlay of computed optical parameters on top of the 3D medical image (bottom right). To compute the optical parameters, NIRFASTSlicer passes segmented images to the NIRFAST MATLAB library for computation, the results of which are then loaded into NIRFASTSlicer for visualization.  NIRFASTSlicer is available for download at

  In addition to the development of NIRFASTSlicer, Kitware has recently been working with a second group in the Optics in Medicine Laboratory.  Dr. Brian Pogue and his student David M. McClatchy III are working with a system that can capture both a CT of an object as well as an image of the object’s surface at the same time.  Kitware has aided their efforts by developing software to calibrate the camera and register the camera image to the CT.  Using this software, they can create meshes of an object’s surface colored via the camera data and overlay it onto the CT as shown below.
