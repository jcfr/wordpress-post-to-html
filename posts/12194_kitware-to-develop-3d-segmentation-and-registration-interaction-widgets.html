  Kitware, Inc. has been tasked by the National Library of Medicine to develop 3D widgets for segmentation and registration. These widgets will be used to assist in manual and semi-automatic tasks of image segmentation and registration. Such tasks often require human intervention, and these interactor widgets will greatly improve the efficiency of the process. The widgets will be provided in open-source form in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) system, and designed for use with either VTK or ITK (Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit).
