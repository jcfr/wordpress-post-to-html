 <p>
  It turns out that the humble optical mouse of a modern computer…
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="299" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_398353929.jpg" width="400"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  is actually a small microscope:
 </p>

   http://web.media.mit.edu/~mellis/mouse/ADNS2620.pdf
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  It contains:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A small, semi-spherical lens of about 1mm radius.
  </li>
  <li>
   A small digital camera of about 13×13 pixels.
  </li>
  <li>
   A powerful laser diode.
  </li>
  <li>
   A well-crafted prism to direct light to just in front of the lens.
  </li>
  <li>
   A dedicated DSP chip.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This humble, little, inexpensive, and under-rated device takes about 1,000 images-per-second, and performs cross-correlation image processing on them in order to estimate your movements on the X,Y plane of your desk!!
 </p>
 <p>
  This little device can do:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Programmable frame speed up to 3000 frames-per-sec (fps)
  </li>
  <li>
   Accurate motion up to 12 ips
  </li>
  <li>
   400 cpi resolution
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Time to rip that mouse apart!
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is the under-surface of the mouse, where we can see the small lens:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="252" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_1494258398.jpg" width="336"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and a close-up of the lens:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="254" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_1162627804.jpg" width="338"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is actually very easy to open, as it has a single screw on the back:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="251" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_1990879175.jpg" width="335"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and then you lift it in diagonal, and slide the cover towards the back:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="251" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_35024567.jpg" width="336"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  vividly exposing the mouse’s internal organs:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="253" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_85056229.jpg" width="339"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular you can see the red plastic cover of the laser LED on the right,
  <br/>
  connected to the transparent, single plastic piece that contains the illumination
  <br/>
  prism and the small lens; and then towards the center, the dedicated DSP
  <br/>
  chip that contains the camera and the image processing hardware.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="264" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_2123954358.jpg" width="353"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  If we plug the USB connector of the mouse into the closest computer,
  <br/>
  we get to see the laser LED turned on:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="262" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_529751753.jpg" width="351"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  This helps to show how the light is guided by the plastic prim, towards the bottom
  <br/>
  of the mouse, as to illuminate the table surface underneath the mouse and just
  <br/>
  facing the small camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can then lift the circuit board by pulling from the mouse head side:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="260" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_567884984.jpg" width="348"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and proceed to extirpate the internal organs:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="261" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_878388466.jpg" width="348"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  by removing the wheel, we can also take a closer look at the infrared LED
  <br/>
  and facing photo-detector that tracks the movements of the rolling wheel:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="267" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_98486511.jpg" width="356"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  by turning over the circuit board we can inspect the other side of the transparent
  <br/>
  plastic that forms the illumination prism, and the small lens:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="264" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_822465703.jpg" width="353"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and a closer look at the small lens, where we can appreciate its high curvature:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="267" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_1840568186.jpg" width="356"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  With a flat screwdriver, we can persuade the translucent piece to be separated from
  <br/>
  the red plastic piece that holds the laser LED:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="268" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_1691441982.jpg" width="359"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  After which you can slide the plastic lens:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="269" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_513171174.jpg" width="359"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and finally expose the small camera under the dedicated DSP chip,
  <br/>
  which is inside the small circular hole in the bottom of the DSP chip:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="269" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_843977333.jpg" width="358"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here we have a closer look at the camera:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="266" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_2134504509.jpg" width="355"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and a closer look a the lens plus illumination prism:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="264" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_930218260.jpg" width="353"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  This piece has been carefully crafted to put a flat surface at just the point where
  <br/>
  the image of the surface will be focused by the lens on the camera inside of the
  <br/>
  DSP chip.
 </p>
 <p>
  After an Evil laugh, we proceed to transplant this mouse organ onto front eye of the closest iPad:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="263" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_98841248.jpg" width="352"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, using a book as sample holder, we place an object very close to the lens:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="264" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_1066300311.jpg" width="352"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  and place on it one of the most mysterious substances known to man: dog hair!
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="265" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_355534690.jpg" width="355"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is the image captured with the iPad (at its 640×480 pixels resolution):
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="264" src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/6_942949514.JPG" width="353"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dog hair typically has a width of about 10 microns.

  In 1665, Robert Hooke wrote in his book
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrographia">
   Micrographia
  </a>
  , his observations of a razor blade under a microscope:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “I have, when the Sun has shone well on them, discovered their surface to be variously razed or scratched, and to consist of an infinite of small broken surfaces, which reflect the light of very various and differing colors. And indeed it seems impossible by Art to cut the surface of any hard and brittle body smooth, since Putte, or even the most curious Powder that can be made use of, to polish such a body, must consist of little hard rough particles, and each of them must cut its way, and consequently leave some kind of gutter or furrow behind it.”
  </em>
