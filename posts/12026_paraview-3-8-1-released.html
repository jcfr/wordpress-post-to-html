  Kitware is pleased to announce the release of ParaView 3.8.1, a patch release over 3.8.0 with a small set of improvements.
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView now comes HDF5 1.8.5. This enables developers to easily create readers and plugins for ParaView that use newer versions of HDF5. We are now including the C++ and the high level (hl) versions of the library for those who wish to use their newer API.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the improvements are two new file formats. The first is a netcdf based reader for MPAS format ocean and atmosphere datasets. The second, available in source form only, is a reader plugin that allows ParaView to read multi-resolution wavelet compressed VAPOR data format files. Thanks to John Clyne and Dan Legreca for contributing the VAPOR plugin.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have improved the support for animation scripting through Python. The new API is more coherent with the rest of the ParaView Python API, avoiding the need for script writers to know minute details regarding how to create animations using proxies. Tracing capabilies for animation were also revised.
 </p>
 <p>
  The GPU volume ray cast mapper for voxel datasets now works in tile display mode. In keeping with our ongoing improvements of ParaView’s charting capabilities, we have included a few fixes regarding labels and axes placements.
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView build and install rules have been cleaned up so developers no longer have to worry about ‘rpath’ and “make install” has been improved on all platforms.
 </p>
 <p>
  This release includes a material interface extraction filter that takes a cell data volume fraction and generates a polydata surface. It also performs connectivity on the particles and generates a particle index as part of the cell data of the output. The filter computes the volume of each particle from the volume fraction and is accessible from the Material Analysis category in the Filters menu.
