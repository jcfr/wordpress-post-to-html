  Kitware is pleased to announce the development of a computational infrastructure for  mapping the mammalian connectome. The project is supported by $999,981  in Phase 2 SBIR funding from the National Institutes of Health.

  A human brain is estimated to have roughly 100 billion neurons  connected through more than 100 thousand miles of axons and a  quadrillion synaptic connections. The neural circuits within each brain  are its connectome; understanding how the connectome works to enable  cognition, consciousness, and intelligence is one of the most  fundamental questions in science.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Advances in modern technology have made it easier to collect and  prepare tissue samples for high-resolution scanning. This leads to  digital representations of the connectome that are currently 60-70  terabytes in size, with this expected to grow rapidly as imaging  technology improves.

  Kitware will lead the development of a computational infrastructure  that will include a set of segmentation algorithms that can extract  neurons and their synapses from electron micrographs of serial tissue  sections, and support arbitrarily large image volumes that will allow  researchers to trace every neural process. Additionally, the suite will  include fusion methods that take segmentation results as input and  generate tracings of neural processes by linking segmentation results  from one section to the next.

  Dr. Charles Law will lead Kitware’s efforts and coordinate with  subcontractors at Harvard. “Understanding the human connectome will make  a huge impact on scientific research,” said Dr. Law. “It’s thrilling to  be developing a platform that has the potential to reveal inner  workings of the brain.”
