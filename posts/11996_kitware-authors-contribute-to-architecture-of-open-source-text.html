  Earlier this month, “The Architecture of Open Source Applications” was published. Edited by Amy Brown and Greg Wilson, the book highlights 25 open-source applications, with the guest authors contributing the chapters. Each chapter covers a different open-source application and discusses the structure and reasoning behind them. Two chapters were written by Kitware team members; Berk Geveci and Will Schroeder contributed a chapter on VTK and Bill Hoffman and Ken Martin contributed a chapter on CMake.
