   3D Slicer
  </a>
  , the free and open-source software package for image analysis and visualization, developed in part by Kitware, has seen recent changes that enhance its flexibility, scalability, and ease-of-use. After significant improvements to
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/slicer-4-1-released/">
   extension/plugin support in 2012
  </a>
  , a major step completed this year is the
  <em>
   CLI AutoRun
  </em>
  feature.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Slicer3:Execution_Model_Documentation">
   Command Line Interface (CLI) model
  </a>
  provides a simple mechanism for incorporating command line programs as Slicer modules. These command line modules are self-describing, emitting an XML description of its command line arguments. Slicer uses this XML description to automatically construct a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the module.

   CLI AutoRun

 <p>
  In order to give more interactivity to Slicer,
  <span style="line-height: 2em;">
   an “AutoRun” button has been added to all the CLI modules:

  </a>
  <br/>
  When enabled, AutoRun allows CLI modules to be automatically executed:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Anytime a parameter is changed:
   </span>
   Searching for the best parameter combination within the parameter space of an algorithm can be somewhat labor intensive. By instantaneously running the CLI module as soon as a parameter is changed by the user, Slicer becomes much closer to the WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) interface.

   <span style="line-height: 2em;">
    Anytime an input data is being modified:
   </span>
   This new feature opens up a wide variety of interesting possibilities. For example, a pipeline of filters can now be created such that changes to any input data are automatically propagated downstream by triggering the execution of the pipeline filters.

 </ul>

  The following short presentation illustrates a few use cases for the AutoRun feature:

  AutoRun is already available in the
  <a href="http://download.slicer.org/">
   nightly builds of Slicer
  </a>
  , and will be part of the next Slicer 4.3 release. Stay tuned for the release announcement!
