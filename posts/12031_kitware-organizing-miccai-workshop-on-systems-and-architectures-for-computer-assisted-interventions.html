  Kitware is co-organizing a workshop on
  <a href="http://www.iccas.de/CAI-Workshop-2010.html">
   Systems and Architectures for Computer Assisted Interventions
  </a>
  at MICCAI 2010. The goal of this workshop is to establish a forum for discussing open  interfaces, architectures, interoperability, and standards for the  development of computer assisted intervention systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Modularization of surgical assist systems has become a topic of growing importance  due to the increasing complexity of system components. Future systems will have to depend on reliable  components and frameworks, which are used as building blocks to realize  the desired functionality. To achieve modularization, standards will be key, as they allow for cross-vendor interoperability. As such, this workshop will focus primarily on modularization and standardization of CAS systems and frameworks and will include strong participation from both industry and academia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Presenatations will educate participants about formal  standardization efforts, such as DICOM in Surgery WG24;  academic efforts  at interoperability, such as OpenIGTLink, TIMMS and SAW; and open interfaces to commercial products. Several examples of CAI systems  will be presented to illustrate success stories and areas for  improvements.
