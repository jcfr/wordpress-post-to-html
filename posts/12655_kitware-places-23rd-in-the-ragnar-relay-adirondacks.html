  Despite spending the majority of our time staring at computer screens, here at Kitware we are clearly also enthusiastic about getting up and moving. Back in 2009 Dave DeMarle got us started on the Saratoga Bike to Work Challenge (where we’ve taken the top spot in our category for 3 of the 5 years we’ve participated). Rusty Blue decided that was too easy by itself, so in 2010 he signed us up for the CDPHP Workforce Challenge (a 3.5 mile road race through downtown Albany) which is typically held the evening before the Bike to Work Challenge! This year, Bill Hoffman decided that we clearly weren’t being challenged enough, so he signed us up for the Ragnar Relay Adirondacks – a mere 196.2 mile relay race from Saratoga Springs to Lake Placid.

  So early last Friday, ten Kitwareans and two of our relatives gathered in the Kitware parking lot to decorate our two vans. Six runners would be “living” in each of these vans through Saturday evening as we followed the race course to drop off, pick up and cheer on our runners. Under the creative leadership of Naomi Hoffman we converted the plain white vans into Scooby Doo Mystery Machines, complete with Scooby Snacks to share with our fellow runners. The Kitware team, pictured above, includes (in roughly left to right order):

      If you are not familiar with the Ragnar Relay Series of road races, they are all approximately 200 miles long held at various times of the year throughout the country. We are lucky to have one so close to us since many of the teams we met during the race drove hundreds of miles to the start line – the Kitware headquarters in Clifton Park is located less than 20 miles from the starting line in Saratoga Springs. (Of course, I’m not opposed to traveling a bit if I could go run the Miami to Key West race in Florida in early February when we are buried in a foot of snow and ice here in upstate NY!)

      You can see the race map on the left showing the starting location in Saratoga Springs, a nice scenic circle around the lake, then the long haul up to Lake Placid. What might not be evident in that map is the mountain range we must traverse to get to Lake Placid. As you can see in the elevation map below, the first perhaps 2/3rds of the race isn’t too bad (except for that one particularly torturous leg that Matt Turek ran which climbed 800 feet and then dropped 800 feet all within about a five mile span!) However, the last third of the race was pretty much all uphill.
