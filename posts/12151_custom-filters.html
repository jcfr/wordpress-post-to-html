  Since the beginning, ParaView 3 has toyed with the idea of user-defined filter packages that could be built on the fly, include pipelines to other filters and be used simply just like ordinary filters. This is what we call
  <em>
   Custom Filters
  </em>
  . Custom filters were redesigned from the ground up so now they work seamlessly with regular filters. Itâ€™s now possible to have multiple pipelines within these filters and as well expose the ends of multiple pipelines as the output.
