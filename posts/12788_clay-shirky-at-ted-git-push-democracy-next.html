   Clay Shirky
  </a>
  has done it again,
 </p>
 <p>
  In a fascinating
  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html">
   TED Talk
  </a>
  , Shirky examines the impact that collaboration tools developed for and by Open Source communities, will have on the way citizens participate in public life and how they can steer the political processes.

  By analyzing the way modern tools such as Git and social sites such as
  <a href="https://github.com/">
   Github
  </a>
  empower large scale Open Source communities to engage in
  <strong>
   Collaboration without Coordination
  </strong>
  , Shirky hints at the impact that these tools are already having in the way large scale organization are engaging with the public.
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, Shirky cites the example of the New York State Senate, and its embrace of
  <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/open">
   Open Government
  </a>
  , through the public availability of software tools sponsored by the NY Senate that empower citizens to have access and provide input on legislation being drafted by the Senate.

    http://www.nysenate.gov/legislation
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Or how Germany is publishing its Laws in Github:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze">
    https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Or the way that the State of Utah is making its legislation available in Github
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="https://github.com/divegeek/utahcode">
    https://github.com/divegeek/utahcode
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <div>
  with the curious implication of being able to see the DIFFs on how the Laws are being amended over time:

 <div>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/divegeek/utahcode/commit/5bce81c9d5e02c2abb1268b597c16afed4d40249#code/32b/02/0305.txt">

    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <p>
  The ability to make diffs is something that Open Source developers have taken for granted for many decades, but that turns out to be revolutionary for Legislators and for the Public who is affected by these Laws.

   “No Democracy anywhere in the world
   <br/>
   offers this feature to its citizens
   <br/>
   for either legislation or for budgets,
   <br/>
   even though those are the things done
   <br/>
   with our consent and with our money.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shirky closes his talk with:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetime,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   In the last decade, in fact.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   It’s Large
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   It’s Distributed
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   It’s Low Cost
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and it is compatible with the ideals of Democracy.
   <br/>
  </em>
  <em>
   The question for us now is:
   <br/>
  </em>
  <em>
   Are we going to let the Programmers keep it for themselves ?
   <br/>
  </em>
  <em>
   or are we going to try and take it
   <br/>
   and press it into service for society at large ?”
