   “Unlike Dr Jarvis, the possibility of better-informed patients
   <br/>
   ‘marching into surgeries and asking things’
   <br/>
   does not fill us with horror.

   <br/>
   should be informed by peer-reviewed research
   <br/>
   than by pressure groups or research as it is reported in the media.”

   not, be allowed to read scientific journal articles. We are encouraged by the growing
