  Kitware is pleased to announce the award of $1M in Phase II funding from the U.S.  Department of Energy to further develop ClimatePipes, a platform for  providing non-researchers with access to and analysis tools for  understanding long-term climate change projections. For this project,  Kitware will collaborate with researchers at the Polytechnic Institute  of New York University.

  The pace of global climate change is expected to accelerate and  impact the fields of public health, infrastructure, water resources, and  more. In recent years, multitudes of climate data have been collected  as part of the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project (CMIP); however, hurdles including large data  size, a lack of adequate metadata, poor documentation, and insufficient  computational and visualization resources have limited research progress  in this area.

  Upon completion, ClimatePipes will make valuable climate data  available to non-researchers including policy makers, health officials,  agriculturists, and industry leaders. Users will be able to run complex  computations and visualizations in the cloud or on a user-provided  cluster, and upload data to a server for analysis and integration.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Phase I, ClimatePipes was developed as a web-based workflow with  interfaces for accessing, querying, and visualizing datasets from  one-or-more sources. In Phase II, Kitware will implement support  mechanisms for more elaborate and relevant queries, and improve the  system’s usability, robustness, and scalability. Advanced querying will  be supported by a semantic search tool that relies on natural language  processing techniques.

  “Climate research is currently impeded by barriers that can be  relieved with capable software,” said Dr. Berk Geveci, Director of  Scientific Computing at Kitware and Principal Investigator on this  project. “ClimatePipes will remove those barriers, enabling the public  to explore climate data on their own and take part in the larger  conversation about climate change.”

  “We are providing climate researchers and non-researchers with the  state-of-the-art tools they need to make sense of climate change and its  potential impacts,” said Aashish Chaudhary, Project Leader on  ClimatePipes. “We are proud to be working on a project that may benefit  the world at large.”
