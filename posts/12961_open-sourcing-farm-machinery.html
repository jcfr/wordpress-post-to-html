  <strong>
   Marcin Jakuboski
  </strong>
  presented the
  <strong>
   Open Source
  </strong>
  version of the
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Global Village Construction Set
  </strong>

  <br/>
  After graduating with a
  <strong>
   Ph.D. in Fusion Energy
  </strong>
  , Marcin started a farm
  <br/>
  in Missouri, and rapidly learned that modern farm machinery was
  <br/>
  <strong>
   not suitable for sustainable farming
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  So he started designing and building tools that were
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Robust
  </li>
  <li>
   Modular
  </li>
  <li>
   Highly Efficient and Optimized
  </li>
  <li>
   Low Cost
  </li>
  <li>
   Made from Local and Recycled Materials
  </li>
  <li>
   That will last a lifetime (not designed for obsolescence)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  He
  <strong>
   built
  </strong>
  them and
  <strong>
   test
  </strong>
  them…

 </p>
 <p>
  and then the
  <strong>
   incredible happened !
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  He
  <strong>
   didn’t
  </strong>
  try to
  <strong>
   patent
  </strong>
  them,
  <br/>
  or keep them as
  <strong>
   trade secrets
  </strong>
  ,
  <br/>
  or build them for
  <strong>
   profit
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead
  <strong>
   he posted the designs in a Wiki
  </strong>
  :
  <br/>
  <a href="http://openfarmtech.org.nyud.net/wiki/Main_Page">
   http://openfarmtech.org.nyud.net/wiki/Main_Page
   <br/>
  </a>
  <a href="http://openfarmtech.org.nyud.net/wiki/Main_Page">
   <br/>
  </a>
  Including:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   3D Designs
  </li>
  <li>
   Schematics
  </li>
  <li>
   Instructional Videos
  </li>
  <li>
   and Budgets
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Marci is not only an
  <strong>
   Engineering Genius
  </strong>
  , he is also a
  <strong>
   TRUE SCIENTIST
  </strong>
  .
  <br/>
  Worthy of Galileo Galilei’s legacy, he made sure that
  <strong>
   others
  </strong>
  could do
  <br/>
  the
  <strong>
   same
  </strong>
  that he did, learn from it, and
  <strong>
   improve
  </strong>
  upon it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then,
  <strong>
   contributors
  </strong>
  all over the
  <strong>
   world
  </strong>
  begin showing up, prototyping
  <br/>
  new machines during dedicated project visits.
 </p>
 <p>
  These are real working tools for farmers.
  <br/>
  He has
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Built a Tractor in
   <strong>
    6 days
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Pressed
   <strong>
    5000 bricks
   </strong>
   in
   <strong>
    one day
   </strong>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Planted
   <strong>
    100 trees
   </strong>
   in
   <strong>
    one day
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
