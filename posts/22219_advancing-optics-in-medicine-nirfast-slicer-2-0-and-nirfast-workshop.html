  Announcing NIRFAST-Slicer 2.0
 </h1>
 <p>
  We are proud to announce the release of NIRFAST-Slicer 2.0 for optical imaging research. Installers are available on
  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nir/nirfast//downloads.php">
   nirfast.org
  </a>
  or directly on
  <a href="https://github.com/nirfast-admin/NIRFASTSlicer/releases/tag/v2.0.0">
   GitHub
  </a>
  .  NIRFAST-Slicer is an open-source toolkit based on

   <a href="http://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_segmenteditor.html">
    SegmentEditor
   </a>
  </span>
  module. Among other features, this module offers a more interactive segmentation process and allows defining masks when editing segments. Previously, volumes had to be typecasted to short through the
  <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">
   Cast Scalar Volume

  , which is not necessary anymore.

  With version 2.0, NIRFAST-Slicer relies fully on the
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/3d-slicer-adds-volumetric-mesh-support/">
   support for volumetric meshes
  </a>
  . Tetrahedral meshes created in NIRFAST-Matlab with CGAL can be imported natively in NIRFAST-Slicer in the
  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">
   Models
  </span>
  module. As shown in the image below, different visualization options allow showing the intersection of the 3D model with the volume slice, cropping the 3D model, and displaying the optical parameters stored at each point of that mesh. Those parameters were computed in NIRFAST-Matlab from the light propagation reconstruction, and can also be thresholded to only display certain cells of the mesh. Previously, the volumetric mesh needed to be resampled within the original volume boundaries with the

  The interface between NIRFAST-Slicer 2.0 with NIRFAST-Matlab has been simplified. In version 1.0, NIRFAST-Matlab was packaged internally which made the process intricate when using a different version of NIRFAST-Matlab or testing custom code outside of the Slicer package. Version 2.0 offers a simple interface within the
  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">
   Create Mesh
  </span>
  module that enables the user to select which NIRFAST-Matlab package to use. The
  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">
   Create Mesh
  </span>
  module has also been improved to handle segmentation inputs, provide better error handling, and enhance the overall user interface.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to other improvements and bug fixes, NIRFAST-Slicer is now based on Slicer 4.9 and on the newest version of the
  <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerCustomAppTemplate">
   Slicer Custom App Template
  </a>
  . The latter relies on the latest features in
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-11-0-available-for-download/">
   CMake 3.11
  </a>
  to improve dependency management and facilitate project maintenance.

  NIRFAST workshop at the OSA Biomedical Optics Congress

 <p>
  Similar to the
  <a href="https://wp.me/p6QpJO-3Ka">
   NIRFAST workshop held two years ago
  </a>
  , we joined some of the NIRFAST program
  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nir/nirfast/people.php">
   main investigators
  </a>
  to host a free pre-conference workshop for the user community at the Optical Society (OSA) Biomedical Optics 2018 Congress. The conference was held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on the first Monday of April. There, we guided attendees through tutorials – available on
  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nir/nirfast/documentation.php">
   nirfast.org
  </a>
  – and provided additional help. We were able to demonstrate the new simplified workflow in NIRFAST-Slicer 2.0 and showcase the capabilities of the new segmentation tools.
