  In February, the ParaView team released version 3.98.1, which focuses on polishing recent features introduced in ParaView 3.98.0, including math-text in annotation, and rendering translucent geometries.
 </p>
 <p>
  The issues with rendering translucent geometries have been addressed and corrected. Rendering datasets with a cell containing more than 512 points no longer causes freezes and segfaults in parallel. The team has also addressed the OSX Mountain Lion runtime issue that seemed to correlate to the number of libraries being loaded or linked.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a number of other improvements, such as minimizing progress messages to eliminate clogs to MPI channels, that can be found in the online change log. The ParaView team encourages you to try the 3.98.1 release and leave your  feedback through the user voice website. The mailing lists are also an excellent resource for information and queries.
