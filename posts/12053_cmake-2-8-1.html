  We are happy to announce the release of CMake 2.8.1. This is a minor release from 2.8.0. In addition to addressing many issues, this version of CMake adds some new features as well. The parallel nmake replacement from Nokia jom, now has its own tested generator in CMake.

  CTest can correctly kill process trees when a timeout occurs. The ctest_* commands have been enhanced to take more options. When using the Intel compilers CMake can correctly determine 32 bit vs. 64 bit builds. When running in parallel mode (-j N), CTest can now compute and use a cost value for each test to ensure the tests are run in an optimal order.
