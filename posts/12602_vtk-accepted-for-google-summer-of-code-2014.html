  We are very pleased to announce that the
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">
   Visualization Toolkit (VTK)
  </a>
  has been accepted as a mentoring organization in
  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">
   this yearâ€™s Google Summer of Code program
  </a>
  . This will be our second time participating, after a
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/community-spotlight-vtks-first-google-summer-of-code/">
   very successful summer in 2011
  </a>
  . If you are a student, or know others interested in taking part, please encourage them to get in touch with us early to discuss ideas for summer projects. We have compiled a
  <a href="http://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/GSoC_2014">
   page full of ideas for projects
  </a>
  we would like to see this summer, and we are happy to consider original ideas too.

  We are looking forward to a very productive summer this year. With a lot of major improvements already in the pipeline for VTK, we are very excited to have the opportunity to work with enthusiastic students on new features that will be integrated in our projects and made available to the wider scientific data processing and visualization community!
