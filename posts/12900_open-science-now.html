  <strong>
   Michael Nielsen
  </strong>
  builds up the argument for
  <strong>
   Open Science
  </strong>
  .
  <br/>
  He eloquently identifies the root of the problem:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “If you are a young researcher…
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   You may think that the […] Wiki is a wonderful idea, in principle,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   but you also know that
   <strong>
    writing a single mediocre paper
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   will do more for your career and your job prospects than
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   a long series of brilliant contributions to such a site.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nielsen continues analyzing the misalignment between the goals
  <br/>
  and principles of scientific research and the incentives and
  <br/>
  reward structures used to motivate and evaluate scientists:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…
   <strong>
    Scientist are not paid or rewarded for sharing data
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   …
   <strong>
    It is all about publishing papers
   </strong>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  This statement illustrates the great irony of the problem:
  <br/>
  That “Publishing” is what gets in the way of “Sharing”,
  <br/>
  or to make it more evident, what is wrong with this situation is that:
  <br/>
  “Publishing” gets in the way of making data “Public.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Publishing”, which should have been the mechanism for “making public” the information gathered during the scientific research process, is frequently the reason why scientists will
  <strong>
   NOT
  </strong>
  share information generously and efficiently. Scientists are motivated to keep information to themselves until they manage to exchange it for
  <strong>
   <em>
    “productivity points”
   </em>
  </strong>
  in the process of publishing papers in high reputation journals, or even in
  <em>
   not-so-high-reputation
  </em>
  ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nielsen raise his concerns about the status quo:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    “There is so much knowledge that is still locked up”
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    “Scientists hold the computer code they write”
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    “They hold their best ideas”
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  His talk concludes with raising our hopes by identifying the
  <br/>
  mechanisms by which we could change the status quo:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “We would like to
   <strong>
    change the culture of science.
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   We want to change the values of individual scientists
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   so they start to
   <strong>
    feel it is part of their job to share
   </strong>
   their
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   data and share their best ideas”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, he makes the Economic connection with funding:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “
  </em>
  <em>
   Any
   <strong>
    publicly funded science
   </strong>
   should be
   <strong>
    open science
   </strong>
  </em>
  <em>
   “
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is perfect timing to remind us that the
  <strong>
   Science and Technology Policy Office,
  </strong>
  the organization that advises the President of the United States on Science Policy matters, is asking for
  <strong>
   your feedback
  </strong>
  on whether Federally funded
  <br/>
  research should result in Open Access papers, and Open Data sharing.
