   </a>
   user group meeting took place in San Diego, CA on Feburary 4, 2012 in conjunction with the SPIE Medical Imaging conference.
  </strong>
  The meeting was attended by participants from Princess Margaret Hospital, Polytechnic Institute of Milan, University of Bern, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Children’s National Medical Center, Arizona State University, and Kitware. Following the previous years’ format, the first part of the meeting was dedicated to short updates on the toolkit from the core developers. Dr. Kevin Cleary, Technical Director of the Bioengineering Initiative at Children’s National Medical Center, opened the meeting by welcoming the participants. He briefly presented the history of the project and identified the main focus of project for the coming year, which includes:

  Dr. Ziv Yaniv, Principal Investigator at Children’s National Medical Center, described the new, on-going developments in IGSTK as related to video support. Dr. Andinet Enquobahrie, Technical Lead at Kitware, announced the big transition to using a Git repository source code control system. He described the Git workflow that IGSTK will be following and discussed how the transition would help engage the user community more, improve the release process and granularity, and facilitate code reviews.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second part of the meeting was devoted to user presentations. There were several interesting talks, but the one that stood out was a presentation by Stefan Weber from the University of Bern who presented his idea, “Open Source Hardware for IGSTK”. His group develops a variety of easy-to-use reference markers that can be easily integrated into the surgical navigation environment.

  In the last portion of the meeting, for the first time this year, we conducted an audience engagement exercise (a breakout session) to gather community input and feedback on the IGSTK roadmap. Dr. Kevin Gary from Arizona State University moderated the exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three questions were presented to the participants to obtain input on pressing concerns for the IGSTK team.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   What new features would you like to see in the IGSTK?
  </li>
  <li>
   What are the biggest obstacles or frustrations to using IGSTK for your projects (lack of integration with other toolkits, complex programming model, etc.)?
  </li>
  <li>
   How can the IGSTK team promote better community involvement (discussion forums, more events, community source contributions, newsletters, etc.)?
  </li>
 </ol>

  At the end of the meeting, a summary of the participants input was presented. Here are the main highlights
