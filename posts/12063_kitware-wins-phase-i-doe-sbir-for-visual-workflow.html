  Kitware has been awarded a Phase I SBIR by the Department of Energy to develop an integrated visual workflow environment which supports increasingly data intensive scientific processes. The work will focus on the data management, comparison and evaluation of extremely large datasets. The open source visualization systems ParaView and VisIt, as well as other emerging data management tools such as MIDAS and the Globus Metadata Catalog Service will be used. Kitware plans to develop a flexible architecture so that other computational tools may be used in place of these in the future.
