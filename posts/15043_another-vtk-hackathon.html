  It was a great turnout. See below for a full list of attendees. This time, our focus was on cleaning up the issue tracker – for maintenance as well as in anticipation of a move to the Gitlab tracker. As of today, 55 bugs have been closed! There are also merge requests for a few more. In addition, we worked on resolving merge requests. 31 merged or closed! Not bad. We plan on holding these hackathon monthly going forward.
