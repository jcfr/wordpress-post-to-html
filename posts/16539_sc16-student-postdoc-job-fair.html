  The middle of November is rapidly approaching, and that means one big thing in the high-performance computing (HPC) community…it’s nearly time for The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC16)! There is a significant contingent of Kitwareans heading off to Salt Lake City, Utah, next weekend for SC16—excited to demo recent work, meet up with collaborators, and participate in the various events and sessions that are part of the conference. One thing in particular that we are looking forward to is the Student/Postdoc Job Fair on Wednesday, November 16, 2016. Kitware has been growing rapidly, and we are actively recruiting and hiring for our HPC &amp; Visualization and Data &amp; Analytics teams. To support our growth, we are participating in the SC16 Job Fair. We are excited about meeting (and hopefully hiring!) the best and brightest in the industry.

  If you are a student, postdoc, or other individual interested in building your career with a rapidly growing, open-source company, please stop by the Kitware table to discuss opportunities with us. If you can’t make it on Wednesday, Kitware is also exhibiting at SC16 and would be happy to talk with you at our booth, #3437, about employment opportunities. We have
