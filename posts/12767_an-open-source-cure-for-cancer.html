 <p>
  Being an artist and having a long time record of combining
  <a href="http://www.artisopensource.net/">
   Art and Open Source
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  he was struck by the transformation from
  <strong>
   Human Being
  </strong>
  to
  <strong>
   Patient
  </strong>
  , and the
  <br/>
  disenfranchisement that it entailed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He decided to change the situation:
 </p>
 <p style=" padding-left: 150px;">
  <em>
   “What I did was to start from information
  </em>
  .
  <br/>
  <em>
   I took my clinical record and transformed into
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   a very personal version of open data
  </em>
 </p>
 <p style=" padding-left: 150px;">
  <em>
   I put them in the Web and
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   created a thing that I called
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   my
   <a href="http://artisopensource.net/cure">
    open source cure
   </a>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, by
  <a href="http://www.artisopensource.net/cure">
   cure
  </a>
  , Salvatore refers to a wider concept of “Cure,”
  <br/>
  where there is space for human connection, art, science, and philosophy.
 </p>
 <p>
  To embrace them all, Salvatore continues:
 </p>
 <p style=" padding-left: 150px;">
  <em>
   “I disclosed my clinical data
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and invited everyone,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   all society to participate in my cure”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  by doing so, a community evolved around his collective of information and has lead to
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   1 Projection Mapping at an Art Collective Concert
  </li>
  <li>
   35 Videos has been produced using his tumor images
  </li>
  <li>
   600 Poems has been written about his condition
  </li>
  <li>
   50,000 Testimonies from people who had received the same diagnoses
  </li>
  <li>
   60 Doctors have contacted Salvatore offering good practical advice
  </li>
  <li>
   40 Doctors received reviews from about 500 people in the site
  </li>
  <li>
   50,000 Strategies for treating cancer has been suggested
  </li>
  <li>
   200 People volunteered to help browse and classify all the information above
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  From all these materials, Salvatore has designed his own strategy to manage his cancer condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this attitude and approach, Salvatore reminds us of the complexity of human beings, and how our health conditions must be approached with a wide spectrum that goes well beyond the biochemistry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Salvatore also demonstrates here, the power of connectivity that emerges when we allow an unfettered free flow of information.
