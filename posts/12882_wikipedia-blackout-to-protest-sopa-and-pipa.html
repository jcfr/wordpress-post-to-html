  <strong>
   January 18, 2012
  </strong>
  , in an unprecedented decision, the Wikipedia community has chosen to blackout the English version of Wikipedia for 24 hours, in protest against proposed legislation in the United States — the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">
   Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)
  </a>
  in the U.S. House of Representatives, and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act">
   PROTECTIP (PIPA)
  </a>
  in the U.S. Senate. If passed, this legislation will harm the free and open Internet and bring about new tools for censorship of international websites inside the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the course of the past 72 hours, over
  <strong>
   1800 Wikipedians
  </strong>
  have joined together to discuss proposed actions that the community might wish to take against SOPA and PIPA. This is by far the largest level of participation in a community discussion ever seen on Wikipedia, which illustrates the level of concern that Wikipedians feel about this proposed legislation. The overwhelming majority of participants support community action to encourage greater public action in response to these two bills. Of the proposals considered by Wikipedians, those that would result in a “blackout” of the English Wikipedia, in concert with similar blackouts on other websites opposed to SOPA and PIPA, received the strongest support.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Today Wikipedians from around the world have spoken about their opposition to this destructive legislation,” said Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia. “This is an extraordinary action for our community to take – and while we regret having to prevent the world from having access to Wikipedia for even a second, we simply cannot ignore the fact that SOPA and PIPA endanger free speech both in the United States and abroad, and set a frightening precedent of Internet censorship for the world.”

 <p>
  We urge Wikipedia readers to make your voices heard. If you live in the United States, find your elected representative in Washington (
  <a class="external free" href="https://www.eff.org/sopacall">

  </a>
  ). If you live outside the United States, contact your State Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or similar branch of government. Tell them you oppose SOPA and PIPA, and want the internet to remain open and free.
