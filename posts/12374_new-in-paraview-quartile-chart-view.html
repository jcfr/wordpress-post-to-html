  To understand the movitation for this, let's take a simple example:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   In ParaView (version 4.3.1 or earlier), let's open
   <strong>
    can.ex2
   </strong>
   dataset. On the
   <strong>
    Properties
   </strong>
   panel, make sure that the
   <strong>
    EQPS
   </strong>
   variable is loaded, and then hit
   <strong>
    Apply
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, in the
   <strong>
    Render View
   </strong>
   , select a few cells using
   <strong>
    Select Cells On (S)
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Apply the
   <strong>
    Plot Selection Over Time
   </strong>
   filter to plot these selected cells over time.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  ​Then, on the
  <strong>
   Properties
  </strong>
  panel, in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Display
   </strong>
  </em>
  properties section, if you select all available cells in the
  <strong>
   Composite Data Set Index
  </strong>
  widget, you'll get something like this:
 </p>
 <p>

  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  While this is okay for a few cells, when the number of selected cells is large (as shown here), the plot becomes useless fairly quickly. What one really wants, in such cases, is a quantitative summary of the attribute values for the selected cells. ParaView 4.3.1 supports that too!
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li value="4">
   Check the
   <strong>
    Only Report Selection Statistics
   </strong>
   property on the
   <strong>
    Properties
   </strong>
   panel for the
   <strong>
    Plot Selection Over Time
   </strong>
   filter, and hit
   <strong>
    Apply
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Then, after enabling only the series that relate to variables of interest (in our case
  <strong>
   EQPS
  </strong>
  ), you get something like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="/blog/files/48_379960052.png" target="_blank">
   <img src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/Small.48_379960052.png" width="100%"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Now you see the plots for min, max, q1, q3, std, avg for the variable
  <strong>
   EQPS
  </strong>
  for all selected cells over time! Better, but this too can get very confusing when there are multiple variables that are being plotted.
  <em>
   <strong style="line-height: 1.6em;">
    Can't we do better ???
   </strong>
  </em>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   With the latest round of changes that landed in ParaView today, the answer to that is
  </span>
  <b style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   YES!!!

 </p>
 <p>
  Introducing
  <strong>
   Quartile Chart View
  </strong>
  . This is now the default view for
  <strong>
   Plot Selection Over Time
  </strong>
  filter. Now, performing Steps 1 through 4 will qive you somethings as follow:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="/blog/files/48_1962495330.png" target="_blank">
   <img src="https://blog.kitware.com/blog/files/Small.48_1962495330.png" width="100%"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of showing separate line plots, this new view shows the
  <strong>
   avg
  </strong>
  value as a line, while coloring the area between
  <strong>
   min-max
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   q1-q3
  </strong>
  (upper/lower quartile) ranges, as shown, making the results easier to understand. You can toggle the visibility of the quartile and/or min-max regions using
  <strong>
   Show Quartiles
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Show Ranges
  </strong>
  properties on the
  <strong>
   Properties
  </strong>
  panel (
  <em>
   <strong>
    Display
   </strong>
  </em>
  section). This also simplifies the
  <strong>
   Series Parameters
  </strong>
  checkboxes in the
  <strong>
   Properties
  </strong>
  panel, with fewer variables to select.
