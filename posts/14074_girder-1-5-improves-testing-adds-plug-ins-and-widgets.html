  The improved testing infrastructure featured in the release makes it easier to develop and test downstream external plug-ins. For the OAuth external plug-in, the release established LinkedIn as a provider. The release also added a plug-in for downloading files by their checksums.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the new plug-in, the release introduced a decorator, known as “filtermodel.” The decorator acts on the return value of a Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoint to filter all returned models based on user identity. The release also provided a developer utility method that creates idempotent directories and a user interface (UI) feature that allows administrators to manually create new users.
 </p>
 <p>
  For web client style checking, the release made the switch to ESLint. The release also launched several new widgets for the core web client in Girder. A new timeline widget displays chronological events and time spans. The jobs plug-in uses this widget to visualize the life cycle of a job. Other new widgets offer capabilities for selecting specific dates and date ranges.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 1.5 release also contributed support to existing widgets in Girder. The search field widget and backend, for example, now search for resources by prefix.
