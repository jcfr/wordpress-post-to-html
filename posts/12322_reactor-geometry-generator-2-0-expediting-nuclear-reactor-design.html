  In today’s technological landscape, it can take engineers over a year to create geometry and meshes for a single nuclear reactor core. To help expedite this process, we have been developing
  <a href="http://www.computationalmodelbuilder.org/rgg/">
   Reactor Geometry Generator
  </a>
  (RGG) and are pleased to announce the release of version 2.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  RGG is the first application that integrates the required tools for creating advanced nuclear reactor models and proper analysis meshes into an intuitive system geared specifically toward nuclear engineers, physicists, and domain experts. RGG is an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) tool that is part of Kitware’s
  <a href="http://www.computationalmodelbuilder.org/">
   Computational Model Builder
  </a>
  (CMB). The tool generates the geometry and meshes that users design and simplifies the way models, geometry, and meshes for reactor cores are built. Using RGG, the process of creating geometry and meshes for a nuclear reactor core can be completed in a matter of days or weeks.

  At each stage of the design process, users can view results and make necessary iterative changes. This allows them to easily model new fuel pins, assemblies, and reactor cores. It also enables them to quickly see results so that they can explore different reactor designs to evaluate various ‘What if’ scenarios. In addition, RGG is built to scale. It implements distributed parallelism, when possible; leverages AssyGen and CoreGen command line tools, as well as CUBIT; and takes advantage of rendering improvements made to the
  <a href="http://vtk.org/">
   Visualization Toolkit
  </a>
  (VTK). This means that RGG is efficient and effective in solving large and complex real-world problems.

  The 2.0 release of RGG includes:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A new file format that supports sharing reactors, pins, and ducts among various sub-assemblies
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The format also provides for creating and sharing libraries of pins, ducts, and materials among different core models.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The preservation of visual attributes such as pins, ducts, assemblies, and material colors
  </li>
  <li>
   Boundary layer support
  </li>
  <li>
   An easier way to create 1/6th and 1/12th hex cores
  </li>
  <li>
   Automatic sectioning for the user, both visually and in the automatic creation of MeshKit-related input files
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In addition, the lengths of pin segments and duct segments no longer have to match, which further simplifies the design process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, with RGG 2.0, users can:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   View both models and resulting meshes
  </li>
  <li>
   View meshes based on material, volume, and side-set classifications
  </li>
  <li>
   Load in meshes created outside of RGG
  </li>
  <li>
   Save sub-sets of meshes based on material
  </li>
  <li>
   Save meshes in both MOAB and Exodus format
  </li>
  <li>
   Quickly replace pins in assemblies and assemblies in a core
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  RGG works on Linux and Mac, with limited support for Windows. It has full work support (from model to mesh), can handle large (&gt; 200,000) pin reactor models, and allows for hex mesh generation of reactor core models using MeshKit and CUBIT. To download the latest release, please visit
