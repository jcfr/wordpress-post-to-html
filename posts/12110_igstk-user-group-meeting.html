  The first ever IGSTK User Group Meeting took place at the SPIE Medical Imaging conference in Orlando, Florida on February 7, 2009. Due to space constraints, the meeting was invitation only. The morning session was dedicated to annual review.
 </p>
 <p>
  During this session, IGSTK core developers presented their work that is incorporated in the new release: IGSTK 4.0. This was followed by an application demo by Jeff Stanley from NDI. In the afternoon session, participants presented applications developed using IGSTK. The applications included an image-guided surgical drill, intraoperative cone-Beam CT for guidance of head and neck surgery, and OpenIGTLink, which integrates Slicer and IGSTK to enable multimodal neuronavigation in neurosurgery and ultrasound-based intervention.
