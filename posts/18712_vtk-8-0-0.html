   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    VTK-m
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   which provides filters that run on GPUs and many-core processors. The VTK-m interface replaces the earlier Piston and Dax interfaces as VTK-m has subsumed them. As of VTK 8.0, there are new filters that average values to cells and points; remove duplicate points; perform clip, contour, and threshold operations; extract external polygonal meshes; and compute gradients and levels of detail. In tandem with this change is a new dependence on C++11 capable compilers as VTK now allows for and relies upon on a selection of C++11 features. VTK’s minimum supported compiler versions are GCC 4.8, Clang 3.3, XCode 5.0 and MSVC 2013. See

It can be used, for instance, to place equally spaced glyphs along a streamline. Point cloud processing received significant capability with filters that densify point clouds, compute density gradients and signed distance functions from them, and extract points within volume occupancy masks.

   In the general area of compilation and platform support note that 10.7 is now our minimum supported MacOS version. Also, debug library suffixes were corrected for Windows. Retina display support has been improved with some work in progress to fix remaining issues for higher resolution displays. On iOS, actor and object picking was fixed.

   In the area of IO, VTK’s use of stat was revised specifically to windows users to open files larger than 4GB. Similarly VTK’s native XML readers were updated to access larger files and to remove a hardcoded limit on the number of readable timesteps. VTK’s thirdparty expat, hdf5 and netcdf had significant updates. MPI-enabled hdf5 is now better supported and netcdfcpp was unbundled from the rest of VTK’s netcdf.

They improved support for 32-bit and 64-bit binary formats and coverage of Lagrangian formats, made it possible to skip the initial conditions directory and thus many of the parsing problems associated with input dictionaries, and made it so that OpenFOAM’s embedded code blocks (used for dynamic coding) are now gracefully skipped by the reader.

   VTK 8.0 is brought to you by the efforts of at least 79 developers who made 1017 commits over the last eight months. This is not including our upstream libraries’ authors and the infrastructure work that went on behind the scenes. We’d like to thank all of the authors, bug reporters, and feature requesters. A special shout out goes to those who tested the release candidates and fixed the items found in them. The next release, 8.1 is expected to be released in the Fall. It will have more GPU capable filters from updates to vtk-m.
