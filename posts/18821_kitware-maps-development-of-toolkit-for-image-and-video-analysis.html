   Kitware made the introductory release of KWIVER this year in January. KWIVER is a repository of open-source software for image and video analysis that includes tools for video stabilization, object detection and tracking, bundle adjustment, camera calibration, three-dimensional data reconstruction, super-resolution imaging and content-based image retrieval.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   “Kitware has been a leading computer vision company since 2007,” Hoogs said. “Our KWIVER toolkit includes many of the best tools that we have developed on U.S. government funding over the years; we are excited to debut a new version of KWIVER at CVPR, which integrates support for the most popular deep learning frameworks into end-to-end video and image analytics.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   The release will enhance KWIVER for use cases in conducting video surveillance and processing underwater images, among others; mature the build process; revise documentation; and better coordinate how various pieces of the toolkit work together. The Motion-imagery Aerial Photogrammetry Toolkit (MAP-TK) is one such piece. When Kitware first presented MAP-Tk at CVPR two years ago, it contained libraries of algorithms and structure-from-motion tools for video analysis. As MAP-Tk grew, its framework and core algorithms
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   suited broader applications. To make them easier to reach, Kitware relocated
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   these components inside KWIVER.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Kitware simultaneously turned the development of MAP-Tk toward specialized end-user tools. The primary tool, which the company now calls TeleSculptor, provides a graphical application for photogrammetry. In MAP-Tk 0.10, Kitware will garnish TeleSculptor with
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   support for carrying out a full structure-from-motion pipeline without receiving aid from command-line tools. Kitware will release MAP-TK 0.10 alongside KWIVER 1.1.
