  Kitware is pleased to announce the release of SimpleITK 0.8.0.  SimpleITK is a simplified layer built on top of ITK. By providing  binaries for several wrapped languages, it facilitates ITK’s use in  rapid prototyping, education, and interpreted languages.

  The 0.8.0 release includes several improvements to SimpleITK  including support for events and command call-backs and support for  compiling OSX Mavericks by automatically enabling C++11. More  information about these improvements can be found on

  The release also improves support for C++11 and for setting  dimensional vector parameters as scalars in the OOP interface. Moreover,  it provides enhancements to the printing of enum types, as well as to  experimental support for generating Python wheels and to ProcessObject  base class features in the OOP interface. Additional release  improvements include the availability of threshold management in  automatic thresholding filters and the use of ITK 4.5.1.
