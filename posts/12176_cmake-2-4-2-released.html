  The latest release of CMake is the 2.4 release. The 2.4 release branch has many new features to support KDE(
  <a href="http://www.kde.org">
   www.kde.org
  </a>
  ), which has chosen CMake as its build system. In addition to improvements in the CMake build system, a new tool called CPack has been added to the CMake family. CPack is a tool to create release packages automatically. It is currently in beta and supports the Nullsoft installer on Windows, the Mac OSX installer, and several forms of compressed tar files. In future releases it will support RPMs and other Linux/UNIX distribution systems.
