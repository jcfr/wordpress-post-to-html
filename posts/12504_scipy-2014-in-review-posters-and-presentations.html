  <strong>
   Overview
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This year’s conference expanded the number of talks by approximately 50%. While the talks spanned two days instead of three, the quality of the talks and posters was as stellar as ever. Although the IPython notebook was the hot topic of last year’s conference, it still held considerable mindshare, and most presentations were delivered with an IPython notebook. Similarly, while reproducibility was not an explicit theme for this year’s conference, it was still an issue addressed in many talks.

 <p>
  At the conference, there were different flavors of talks, which shared commonalities in that they were about science and computing with Python, were informative, and were interesting. The conference talks included inspirational keynotes on

  </a>
  and

  </a>
  . In addition, solutions were proposed to interesting social problems, including enabling contributions with a

 </p>
 <p>
  Aashish Chaudhary presented a talk on
  <a href="http://conference.scipy.org">
   Climate &amp; GIS: User friendly data access, workflows, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of climate and geospatial datasets
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Bradley Lowekamp presented the
  <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2763/simpletitk-advanced-image-analysis-for-python">
   SimpleITK talk
  </a>
  , which was co-authored by Luis Ibáñez and Matt McCormick. The talk was well received, and we had a number of great conversations with attendees who were not very familiar with ITK/SimpleITK, as well as with many who were simply happy to see our presence and support.
