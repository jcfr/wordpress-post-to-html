    New Award to Improve Air Force Video Analyst Workflows with VIRAT
   </strong>
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Kitware received a new broad agency announcement (BAA) award from the Air Force Research Laboratory to integrate our Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) functionality with the agency’s Planning &amp; Direction, Collection, Processing &amp; Exploitation, Analysis &amp; Production, and Dissemination experimentation environment (PCPAD-X). Integration of these two tools will improve analyst performance in exploiting Full Motion Video (FMV).
 </p>
 <p>
  FMV exploitation is currently very labor intensive, and often involves teams of people monitoring a single video feed to extract the value for the primary mission. There are a number of drawbacks to this approach as it requires analysts to monitor the video feed and “call out” events for another analyst to record. The monitoring analysts focused on finding mission-specific elements of interest may overlook other events and objects of interest to other parties. In addition, the communication of events between shifts of analysts on a particular mission, or to outside entities, is cumbersome and may result in non-standard, fragmented descriptions of events and other salient information.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have developed a powerful FMV exploitation capability that addresses a number of drawbacks to the current process. The VIRAT tool, developed primarily under DARPA funding, automatically processes FMV in real-time to extract and record elements of interest, including moving targets and events, or objects that match a specific appearance model.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this project, VIRAT will be integrated with PCPAD-X to extend its capabilities to increase analyst productivity, provide an improved user interface and more standardized communication and recording mechanisms, and include a state-of-the-art object tracking system for automatically detecting unusual events in the data using normalcy models.

    U.S. Air Force Research Lab Award to Extend Bender Toolkit
   </strong>
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Kitware received a new Phase I SBIR award from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to advance the Bender toolkit. The project aims to reduce the time required for anatomical model pose manipulation and for simulating anthropomorphic changes, such as an increase in body-mass index (BMI).
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bender improvements will be a multi-stage process, beginning with extending the toolkit to make use of freely available libraries of pose and motion data. Next, the user interface will be broadened to support the specification of changes in regional fat or muscle volumes so that the BMI of the model can be changed. Ultimately, real-time, GPU-based surgical simulation methods will be integrated to speed the computation of realistic anatomic dynamics.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Phase I effort will include replacing the dual-quaternion skinning capabilities already implemented in Bender with Kitware’s multi-grid solver in order to improve speed and reduce memory requirements while also providing more accurate motion models. This work will build upon the linear and non-linear finite element modeling (FEM) solvers in the “Simulation Open Framework Architecture” (SOFA) toolkit for surgical simulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The primary result of this Phase I exploration and the planned Phase II development effort will be an intuitive program for performing voxelized anatomical model rigging, manipulation, and resampling.

    NIH Phase II SBIR Award to Develop Open-Source Digital Pathology System
   </strong>
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Kitware recently won a new $1M Phase II SBIR from the National Institutes of Health to enhance and further deploy its open-source digital pathology system. On the heels of a successful Phase I SBIR project, the Kitware team and our collaborators will improve their digital pathology system and web portal to facilitate a large pathology network, bringing pathology into the digital realm already enjoyed by other medical specialties and scientists. The inexorable push toward digital data acquisition has not yet taken hold in pathology, but with this open-source system, pathologists will see benefits such as easy annotation and markup of whole slide images, flexible data archival and sharing, telepathology, 3D visualization and informatics, and education.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of the Phase II effort, new development will be focused on the architecture and web portal, formalizing an analysis framework and related tools, and generating new digital pathology content for both educational and reference purposes. The data-centric architecture will provide the foundation for data ingestion and processing of whole slide images (WSI), and support web-based display on a variety of devices including mobile devices. With that foundation, the team will develop a web portal that will enable users to upload, share, search, and view WSI. The web portal will also be the basis for the Digital Pathology Journal that will enable dissemination of results, including large and distributed images with annotations.

   <strong>
    New Award to Develop Advanced Sparse Bundle Adjustment System
   </strong>
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Kitware announced new Phase I SBIR funding from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to develop innovative software for performing sparse bundle adjustment for full motion video (FMV) and wide-area motion imagery (WAMI).
 </p>
 <p>
  Sparse bundle adjustment (SBA) is a technique for refining 3D scene geometry and the parameters of relative camera motion using images taken from different viewpoints. This technique has existed since the 1950s, but it is only in the past decade that the computational resources required to perform large-scale spare bundle adjustment have become available and practical to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Existing open-source toolkits for SBA are slow and focus on large collections of unordered images. Significant optimizations can be made for SBA by exploiting properties found in aerial video, particularly temporal continuity. These optimizations are available at all stages of the camera calibration pipeline, from feature detection and matching to SBA itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this new Phase I funding, Kitware will develop an SBA system targeted for aerial video that will produce state-of-the-art camera calibration accuracy in a fraction of the time compared to current unordered image collection software. A variation of the techniques developed under this project can also be used to construct a streaming SBA solution for live video.  Furthermore, relaxation of the specific constraint that bundle adjustment accuracy be optimal over all images could enable real-time, streaming video feeds onboard military vehicles for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  To achieve these goals, Kitware will leverage its world-renowned computer vision expertise, algorithms, and open-source libraries to perform feature detection, feature matching, and sparse optimization.
 </p>
 <p>
  "We're excited for the opportunity to improve a well-known yet under-utilized functionality and make a significant impact on video analyst workflows," said Matthew Leotta, Principal Investigator on this project. "An additional benefit is that our newly-developed system will build upon open-source software and our developed SBA toolkit will also be released to the public as open source."
