   This is a patch release that stabilizes both the extensions manager built-in the application and the extensions build system. The extensions manager and associated build system provide users and developers a way  to quickly extend the functionality and the look-and-feel of Slicer for specific biomedical and clinical research applications. With the extension manager, extensions can be shared with the community in an “app-store” style system that integrates tightly with the Slicer experience. To complement these improvements, extensions-specific documentation was written.
