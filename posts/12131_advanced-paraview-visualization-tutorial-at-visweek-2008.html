  ParaView is a powerful open-source turnkey application for analyzing and visualizing scientific datasets ranging from small desktop-sized problems to the world’s largest simulations.  ParaView is used by numerous government, educational, and commercial institutions throughout the world.  Designed to be configurable, extendible, and scalable, ParaView is built upon the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) to allow for the rapid deployment of visualization components. Through this tutorial, organizer Kenneth Moreland of the Sandia National Labs brought together David Thompson (Sandia), Timothy Shead (Sandia), John Biddiscombe (CSCS) and Utkarsh Ayachit (Kitware) whom are all designers and builders of ParaView as means of giving researchers and developers detailed guidance on the behavior and abilities of the ParaView application.

  This knowledge allowed the tutorial participants to solve their unique visualization problems, modify the ParaView application to their specific problem domains, or leverage the design into their own applications.  Participants were taught how to customize their visualization with selection, scripting, plugins, and vertical applications.  Additionally the tutorial covered some of ParaView’s new and advanced features including higher order elements, particle visualization, and information visualization.
