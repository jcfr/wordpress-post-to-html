  To better serve the open-source software community and our collaborators, Kitware is increasing the course offerings for this fall. In addition to the three courses already scheduled in our Lyon location, we will be hosting three on-site courses in New York and adding three courses into our regular online rotation. The on-site courses

  , and
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/what-we-offer/#training">
   CMake and Friends
  </a>
  , will be day-long courses held at Kitwareâ€™s corporate headquarters in Clifton Park, NY. Taught by experts from Kitware who are some of the key contributors to the toolkits, the courses will provide in-depth, hands-on experiences for individuals looking to gain a better understanding of the software.

 <p>
  The online courses, using the same format as the ITK, VTK, ParaView and CMake online courses, will be introductions to Slicer, the Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK), and Midas. This is an opportunity for beginners to gain a deeper understanding of the software, explore use-case scenarios, and understand how to leverage the tools for their own work. These introductory online webinars are free, although advanced registration is required and space is limited.
