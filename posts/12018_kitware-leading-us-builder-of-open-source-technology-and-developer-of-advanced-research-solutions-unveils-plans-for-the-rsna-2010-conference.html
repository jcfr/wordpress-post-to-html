  ) and Visualization Tool (
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">

  </a>
  ). Avila and Aylward will summarize the rigorous software practices that ensure the high-quality functionality and cross-platform stability of those toolkits as well as review open-source applications such as Slicer3, which is used for medical image visualization and analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  At its booth, located in the Lakeside Center, Hall D: 1305, Kitware will feature a number of applications including their volumetric lesion sizing technology as an example of quantitative imaging for clinical trials as well as IGSTK, a next-generation environment for performing image-guided surgery research. They will also feature more advanced research applications which use free and open source (FOSS) toolkits like Slicer and MIDAS as a solution for web-based image archiving and processing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A number of open-source technologies will be highlighted including those that can measure CT acquisition variability in research settings, perform GPU-accelerated volume rendering and even analyze medical images through advanced segmentation techniques. In particular, Kitware will describe and provide hands-on demonstrations of the open source lesion sizing toolkit at RSNA’s Quantitative Imaging Reading Room. This will include results of an open source reference algorithm for the volumetric assessment of CT lung lesions. Kitware will also offer presentations on the firm’s software engineering tools, CMake, CDash and CTest.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, Avila will give a scientific presentation on a new CT Quality Assurance Pocket Phantom, co-authored with Mount Sinai and Roche Pharmaceuticals that is revealing significant results on the variability of CT scanners.
 </p>
 <p>
  Avila and Aylward will be accompanied to RSNA 2010 with Kitware Technical Leaders, Wes Turner and Brad Davis, as well as Karthik Krishnan who specializes in research for both medical image analysis and visualization problems.
