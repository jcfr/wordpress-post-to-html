  While explaining how to better design visualizations,
  <br/>
  he is elaborating,
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…but we would rather have people…
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   the viewers,
   <br/>
   …ah…the users…”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  and is suddenly struck by a realization.
  <br/>
  He reflects:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…that’s a strange word… ‘
   <strong>
    Users
   </strong>
   ‘.
   <br/>
   There are only two industries…
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   that describe their customers as ‘
   <strong>
    Users
   </strong>
   ‘…”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  One of those is the computer industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tufte’s point illustrates an environment of separation
  <br/>
  and alienation that distance software developers from
  <br/>
  the constituency that they serve.
 </p>
 <p>
  The labeling is important, since it embodies and brings
  <br/>
  to life attitudes and roles that are not healthy for the
  <br/>
  developers or the customers. In particular, it creates
  <br/>
  an environment in which developers are masters and
  <br/>
  users are passive recipients. This labeling and
  <br/>
  separation must be broken for the greater good.
  <br/>
  The way to break it is by
  <strong>
   building communities
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  We have referred before to this as
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/opening-open-source/">

 </p>
 <p>
  A great source of wisdom on how to build communities
  <br/>
  are
  <a href="http://www.peterblock.com/">
   Peter Block
  </a>
  ‘s writings, particularly his book:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Community.html?id=3sEukiSw0fwC">
   Community: The Structure of Belonging
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  where he makes a point about how today many
  <br/>
  organizations tend to turn
  <strong>
   “Citizens”
  </strong>
  into
  <strong>
   “Consumers”
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  He points out that
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…the only way to build a better future is to create
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   a greater sense of
   <strong>
    connectedness
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    belonging
   </strong>
   .”

 <p>
  Following Block’s advice, to reach their full potential,
  <br/>
  Open Source communities must depart from the
  <br/>
  dichotomy of
  <strong>
   “developers”
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   “users
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   ”
  </strong>
  and
  <br/>
  focus on the general empowerment of
  <br/>
  “
  <strong>
   community members
  </strong>
  “.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr. Block continues:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…building a social fabric
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   is more important that
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   coming up with a short term fix”
  </em>

 </p>
 <p>
  He further elaborates on how communities are built.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…Communities are built when people’s
  </em>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Gifts
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Assets
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Passions
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Strengths
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Capacities
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   are brought into the world.
   <br/>
   …Community is
   <strong>
    not
   </strong>
   built with
  </em>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    More services
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Better leadership
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Better programs
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Best practices,
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   These are all fine.
   <br/>
   They are just
   <strong>
    not decisive
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   they are
   <strong>
    not powerful
   </strong>
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Community is built when we decide
   <br/>
   that
   <strong>
    gift-mindedness
   </strong>
   is at its core.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  To build long-lasting and innovative Open Source software we should
  <br/>
  avoid using the labels ‘
  <strong>
   Users
  </strong>
  ‘ and ‘
  <strong>
   Developers
  </strong>
  ,’and rather think
  <br/>
  in terms of ‘
  <strong>
   Community Members
  </strong>
  ‘, all of whom bring their
  <strong>
   Gifts
   <br/>
  </strong>
  to the community. They bring their assets, passion, strengths,
  <br/>
  and capacities. They bring their bug reports, feature requests,
  <br/>
  bug fixes, documentation, use cases, reports, questions, answers,
  <br/>
  reflections, and experiences. All this together forms the
  <strong>
   Culture
  </strong>
  <br/>
  of the community and creates its common fabric.
 </p>
 <p>
  Community members are empowered by knowing that each one of them
  <br/>
  has something to contribute. No matter how small, every bit, by the fact
  <br/>
  of being given generously, becomes a fundamental gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  The process builds a place that we all own, and for which we all are
  <br/>
  responsible. When it gets dirty, it is up to each and every one of us
  <br/>
  to clean it up. When it breaks, it is up to every one of us to fix it.
  <br/>
  This is how we create a space where we are at home and in which
  <br/>
  we belong.
