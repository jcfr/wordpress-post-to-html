  As Python continues to be one of the most preferred means of interacting with ParaView, release candidate 3 contains new support for creating animation tracks that use Python scripts to build highly-customizable animations. We’ve also added new capabilities to our plugin support, making it easier to load deployed plugins on server processes. All distributed plugins are now listed on the client side as well as the server side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Updates have also been made to the streaming framework at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The multi-resolution view now adjusts the resolution to match the projected image size. Additionally, VTK filters can now modify meta-information, allowing users to modify data while the streaming framework culls and prioritizes pieces; for example, the new spherical warp filter projects flat data onto a globe while successfully tracking bounding box pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, support updates have made for users of the cosmology and windblade formats. For example, the MaskPoints filter for placing glyphs, etc. was updated with new options for improving random sampling in parallel. VTK’s Gaussian Splatter filter was likewise exposed in ParaView, making it easier to visualize point set data with imaging filters. The cosmology and windblade readers have also been revised.
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView 3.12 also includes major improvements to the underpinnings of the ParaView ServerManager. The communication layer beneath the ServerManager was upgraded to minimize communication and make it easier to debug and track messages exchanged between the client and server.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smaller yet notable improvements included in ParaView 3.12 include views now using caching to avoid re-renders from repairs due to menus and dialog popups on the screen; volume rendering of uniform grids to support shading; and the ability to enable specular highlights when using scalar coloring, etc.
