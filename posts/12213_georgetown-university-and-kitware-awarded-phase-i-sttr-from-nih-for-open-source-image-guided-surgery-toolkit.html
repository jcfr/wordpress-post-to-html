  Minimally invasive abdominal interventions are rapidly increasing in popularity. This is due to the development of new interventional techniques-and the desire on the part of both clinicians and patients to decrease trauma. Minimally invasive interventions are done using catheters, needles, or other instruments that are introduced, targeted, and manipulated without the benefit of the direct visibility afforded by the usual surgical opening. This greatly minimizes trauma to the patient, but severely restricts the physicianâ€™s view of the underlying anatomy. Image-guided surgery, however, circumvents this encumbrance. It uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans to guide minimally invasive surgical procedures. The scans are typically taken before and during surgery.

  Kitware will team with Dr. Kevin Cleary and his staff at Georgetown University to develop software tools to support the tracking and control of image-guided surgical instrumentation. The software will be created under open-source license to encourage the dissemination of this technology, and to create a technology core that will be leveraged in future products and applications of the technology.
