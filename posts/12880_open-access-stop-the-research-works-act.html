  The “
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act">
   Research Works Act
  </a>
  ” is a proposed legislation that will forbid
  <br/>
  US Federal Agencies from requiring the public dissemination of the
  <br/>
  results of Publicly funded research.
 </p>
 <p>
  If passed, this legislation will destroy the
  <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">
   NIH Public Access policy
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  and preclude the adoption of similar Public Access policies by other
  <br/>
  Federal  Agencies.

    A new bill, The Research Works Act (H.R.3699), designed to roll back the NIH Public Access Policy and block the development of similar policies at other federal agencies has been introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives. Co-sponsored by Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), it was introduced on December 16, 2011, and referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

    Essentially, the bill seeks to prohibit federal agencies from conditioning their grants to require that articles reporting on publicly funded research be made accessible to the public online.
   </div>
   <div>
   </div>
   <div>
    The bill text is short and to the point. The main point reads:
   </div>
   <div>
   </div>
   <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <em>
     “
     <strong>
      No Federal agency may adopt
     </strong>
     , implement, maintain, continue, or otherwise engage in
     <strong>
      any policy
     </strong>
     , program, or other activity that — (1) causes, permits, or
     <strong>
      authorizes network dissemination
     </strong>
     of any private-sector research work
     <strong>
      without the prior consent of the publisher
     </strong>
     of such work; or (2)
     <strong>
      requires
     </strong>
     that any actual or prospective author, or the employer of such an actual or prospective
     <strong>
      author
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      assent to network dissemination
     </strong>
     of a private-sector research work.”

    It has been clarified that the bill interprets
    <strong>
     “private-sector research”
    </strong>
    to include all the papers that institutions produce under Federal funding support.

   <div>
   </div>
