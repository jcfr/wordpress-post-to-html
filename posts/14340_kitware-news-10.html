  Five colleagues—Will Schroeder, Ken Martin, Lisa Avila, Charles Law, and Bill Hoffman—formed Kitware in 1998 around the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and a commitment to practicing open source. Since this time, Kitware has grown to employ over 120 technical and administrative team members with expertise spanning high-performance computing and visualization, data and analytics, medical computing, computer vision, and software process, among other domains.
  <br/>
  Kitware looks forward to many more years of providing open-source software solutions and working with collaborators to advance the state-of-the-art.

     WACV Experts Weigh in on Video Analysis
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Members of the computer vision team at Kitware traveled to Lake Placid, New York, for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV). The conference featured plenary speakers from world-class institutions; workshops on applications in surveillance and transportation; and tutorials on deep learning and domain adaptation. Kitware increased its participation in the conference this year by exhibiting at and sponsoring the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anthony Hoogs, Ph.D.; Matt Turek, Ph.D.; Arslan Basharat, Ph.D.; and Matt Leotta, Ph.D., represented Kitware at WACV. Hoogs co-organized the 2nd Workshop on Automated Analysis of Video Data for Wildlife Surveillance and served as one of the conference general chairs. The well-attended workshop offered insights into estimating wildlife populations through algorithms and tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leotta also shared expertise on video data in his presentation on the paper “Open Source Structure-from-Motion for Aerial Video.” In particular, he detailed how software Kitware developed offers enhanced feature tracking, loop closure, and bundle adjustment capabilities. Leotta is an author of the paper along with Eric Smith, Ph.D.; Matthew Dawkins; and Paul Tunison.

     Goolge Summer of Code Selects Open Chemistry for Participation
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Google Summer of Code (GSoC) announced Open Chemistry as one of its 180 participating organizations for 2016. For the program, members of the Open Chemistry development team will guide students through the process of contributing open-source code. Marcus Hanwell, a technical leader on the scientific computing team at Kitware, will serve as a mentor in this year’s program. Hanwell has previous experience in the program not only as a mentor, but also as a student. In past years, he helped facilitate the participation of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). VTK had a presence in the program in 2011, 2014, and 2015.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Open Chemistry project employs cross-platform tools to advance the fields of computational chemistry and materials science. These tools include Avogadro 2 for editing and visualizing molecular data, MoleQueue for increasing access to computing resources from graphical applications, and MongoChem for storing collections of molecules. This year, GSoC project ideas for Open Chemistry aim to add support for biological data, representations, and visualizations in Avogadro 2; integrate cclib with Avogadro 2; and improve the performance of bond perception in Open Babel, which MongoChem utilizes for desktop cheminformatics.

     List Recognizes Kitware Among Tech Services Companies
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Albany Business Review” published its list of technology services companies, and Kitware made the top ten for a second consecutive year. The list organizes companies based on the number of full-time employees they staff locally. With over 75 team members in its Clifton Park, New York, headquarters, Kitware ranked eighth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Company-wide so far this year, Kitware has welcomed a Technical Leader, a research and development intern, and three research and development engineers. With plans for continued growth, Kitware is hiring for new technical and support positions, including ones located in the Capital Region of New York. Kitware attracts top talent by offering competitive benefits and many unique perks. One such perk is Wings Day—a monthly tradition at Kitware. For the March celebration, team members filled picnic tables outside of company headquarters to feast on a buffet of hot wings and other fried comfort foods.

     Project Aims to Broaden Reach of Open-source System for Image Analysis
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware kicked off two National Library of Medicine (NLM) projects to increase synergy between Python and SimpleITK. The efforts to add support for Python in SimpleITK will improve performance and make the open-source, cross-platform system for image analysis easier to build, package, distribute, and install.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Python is fundamental for open, transparent, and reproducible science,” Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin, a research and development engineer at Kitware, said. “By adding support for Python, we aim to increase the use of SimpleITK in the scientific Python community.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The projects seek to better integrate SimpleITK into the scientific Python ecosystem by enhancing SimpleITK packaging and data handling methods, respectively. To enhance packaging, Fillion-Robin is leading a team of experts at Kitware in developing an infrastructure that will permit the distribution of SimpleITK as a Python package. To make this distribution possible, the infrastructure will incorporate a new and reusable Python build tool that will enhance the sustainability of SimpleITK and simplify its installation process.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Those looking to use SimpleITK for the first time will no longer need advanced knowledge of complex C++ application development,” Fillion-Robin said. “This means that more members of the scientific Python community can take advantage of SimpleITK and its unique capabilities for processing large-scale images in two and three dimensions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  To refine data handling methods in SimpleITK, an interdisciplinary team from Kitware is working to bridge the system with Python libraries for handling images and arrays. Once completed, the effort will bolster the performance of SimpleITK scripts so that they transfer less data to and from the libraries to save time, decrease memory usage, and diminish the potential for performance bottleneck.
 </p>
 <p>
  “SimpleITK can quickly develop scripts and full-scale applications that leverage the power of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) to ingest image data and perform segmentation and registration,” Patrick Reynolds, a research and development engineer  and the leader of the SimpleITK data handling effort at Kitware, said. “Our work will better facilitate the adoption of these scripts and applications into modern analytic workflows.”
 </p>
 <p>
  SimpleITK is a simplified layer built on ITK. It provides an extensive suite of software tools for use in rapid prototyping, education, and interpreted languages.
