  Earlier this month, we attended the 3D Slicer
  <a href="http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2017_Winter_Project_Week">
   2017 Winter Project Week
  </a>
  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, MA. The project week is a semi-annual event, where 3D Slicer users and developers gather to discuss and work collaboratively on open-science solutions for problems that occur at the intersection of the computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medical fields.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the week, we joined approximately 100 attendees—mainly from the U.S., with some traveling from Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden—to work on close to
  <a href="http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2017_Winter_Project_Week#Projects">
   60 projects
  </a>
  that cover deep learning and graphics processing units (GPUs), web technologies, image-guided therapy (IGT), diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quantitative imaging informatics, shape analysis, segmentation, 3D Slicer infrastructure, 3D Slicer training, and 3D Slicer dissemination. We made progress on specific technical issues; helped the 3D Slicer community with our expertise; and discussed 3D Slicer’s design, roadmap, and key priorities.

  Overall, the consensus at the project week was to continue to maintain a lean, robust, and well-documented 3D Slicer core that can be easily extended and to enable the use of the platform in the cloud for easier integration with web technologies, cloud-based infrastructures and deep learning frameworks like

   Volumetric Mesh Support
  </b>

 <p>
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/alexis-girault/">

  from Kitware led the effort to bring back volumetric mesh visualization capabilities within 3D Slicer, a work initiated by Curtis Lisle and Steve Pieper in the previous major release of 3D Slicer. A
  <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/647">
   pull request
  </a>
  is currently under review. It will enable 3D Slicer to read/write and display finite element volumetric meshes within its three-dimensional and slice viewers. By taking advantage of the modularity of VTK data structures, Alexis was able to generalize the Model infrastructure to work with vtkPointSet,  the base class of vtkPolyData (surface mesh) and vtkUnstructuredGrid (volumetric mesh). With the help of Andras Lasso and the feedbacks of numerous other Slicer developers, Alexis refactored the visualization pipeline to better manage displaying models, and improved the module interface for usability.

   Improved Transform Interaction

 <p>
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/johan-andruejol/">
   Johan Andruejol

  from Kitware led the effort to improve 2D and 3D view user interaction by supporting interactive translation, rotation and scaling of models and images. After creating a proof of concept, Johan had a good basis to discuss with Andras Lasso from Queens and clearly define  the widget allowing user to interact. It was decided that the transformations widget should automatically be centered around the objects to transform. Support will be first added in the 3D view and then in the 2D view.

  To wrap up this post, we will again leave you with some food for thought. 3D Slicer is no longer a monolithic infrastructure; it is a modular framework that allows you to either create professional-scale applications or quickly prototype ideas. Similar to what
  <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">
   ParaView
  </a>
  is for scientific computing, 3D Slicer is your tool for medical imaging. Both ParaView and 3D Slicer allow you to share your creative and efficient solutions built on top of CMake, the
  <a href="http://www.commontk.org/index.php/Main_Page">
   Common Toolkit
  </a>
  (CTK), the
  <a href="http://itk.org/">
   Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
  </a>
  (ITK), Python, or the
  <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">
   Visualization Toolkit
  </a>
  (VTK).
