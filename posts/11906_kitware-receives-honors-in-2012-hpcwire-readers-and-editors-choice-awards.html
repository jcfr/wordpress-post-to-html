  Kitware has been recognized in the annual HPCwire Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards, presented at the 2012 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC12), in Salt Lake City, Utah.

  Kitware’s open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application, ParaView, was selected as the Editors’ Choice for Best HPC Visualization Product or Technology. This marks the third consecutive year that Kitware has been recognized by HPCWire, winning an Editors’ Choice award for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) in 2011, and both Editors’ and Readers’ Choice awards for ParaView in 2010.

  The HPCwire Editors’ Choice Awards are determined through a rigorous selection process, where winners are chosen by a panel of editorial and executive staff, recognized HPC dignitaries, and contributing editors from across the industry. “The awards represent the highest level of recognition to the leaders and luminaries in the high performance computing industry by our HPCwire readers and the community alike. Our warmest congratulations go out to all the recipients of this year’s awards,” said Jeff Hyman, president and group publisher of Tabor Communications Inc.
