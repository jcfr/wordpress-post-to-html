  Kitwarians in the Carrboro, North Carolina office set out for a day of fun on the ice at the Triangle SportsPlex located in Hillsborough on February 18th.  There were 11 people who ventured out to ice skate. The weather inside the complex was cold, but outside it was sunny and 64 degrees! Experience for this event ranged from former hockey players to the novices. Benjji was recovering from an ankle injury, so he took on the role of event photographer and got some great pictures. The day was topped off by nachos, pretzels, and Wendy’s eight-angle yoga pose – which was not done on the ice! A fun day was had by all!
