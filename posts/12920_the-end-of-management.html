   General Hugh Shelton
  </a>
  <br/>
  14th Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
  <br/>
  in his memoirs
  <br/>
  “Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  General Shelton, a man who clearly have a thing or two to say
  <br/>
  about how to direct a large organization share this bit of wisdom
  <br/>
  with us in his memoirs:
  <strong>
   Command and Control is an Illusion.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a remarkable idea, coming from a man who has been one
  <br/>
  of the top ranking commanders of an organization where we would
  <br/>
  not be expecting anything difference than full compliance with the
  <br/>
  orders of a strict institutional hierarchy.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of the presumption that a pyramidal hierarchical structure
  <br/>
  is needed to prevent human beings from running into chaos, we see
  <br/>
  that the only real asset that you can count on, is what Open Source
  <br/>
  communities have demonstrated to be the most effective method
  <br/>
  of undertaking big challenges:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Have
   <strong>
    Clarity of Purpose
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Create effective means of communication
  </li>
  <li>
   Remove the obstructions to individual initiative
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dee Hock, the Former CEO of VISA and VISA International,
  <br/>
  also a man who knows about the reality of running a large
  <br/>
  organization, gives us similar drops of wisdom in his book
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “One From Many:
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hock says:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Since the
   <strong>
    strength and reality
   </strong>
   of
   <strong>
    every organization
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   lies in the
   <strong>
    sense of community
   </strong>
   of the people
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   who have been attracted to it,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   its success has enormously more to do with
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    clarity of shared purpose
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    common principles
   </strong>
   , and
   <strong>
    <br/>
    strength of belief
   </strong>
   in them,
   <br/>
   than with money, material assets, or
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   management practices,
   <br/>
   important as they may be.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  These points are worth repeating:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Clarity of Shared Purpose
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Common Principles
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Strength of Belief
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “When an organization loses its shared vision and principles,
   <br/>
   its
   <strong>
    sense of community
   </strong>
   , its
   <strong>
    meaning
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    values
   </strong>
   ,
   <br/>
   it is already in process of
   <strong>
    decay and dissolution
   </strong>
   ,
   <br/>
   even though it may linger with the outward
   <br/>
   <strong>
    appearance of success
   </strong>
   for some time.
   <br/>
   Businesses, as well as nations, races, and tribes die out
   <br/>
   not when defeated or suppressed,
   <br/>
   but when they
   <strong>
    become despairing
   </strong>
   and
   <br/>
   <strong>
    lose excitement
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    hope
   </strong>
   about the
   <strong>
    future
   </strong>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Hock is deeply aware of the importance of
  <strong>
   Purpose
  </strong>
  <br/>
  as the soul of any organization:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Without deeply held,
   <strong>
    commonly shared purpose
    <br/>
   </strong>
   that gives
   <strong>
    meaning
   </strong>
   to their lives;
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   without deeply held,
   <strong>
    commonly shared ethical values
    <br/>
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    beliefs
   </strong>
   about
   <strong>
    conduct
   </strong>
   in
   <strong>
    pursuit of that purpose
    <br/>
   </strong>
   that
   <strong>
    all may trust
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    rely
   </strong>
   upon,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   communities steadily disintegrate,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and
   <strong>
    organizations
   </strong>
   progressively become
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    instruments of tyranny
   </strong>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Sensing whether your organization still has a Soul,
  <br/>
  is an exercise that must be done on a daily basis.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “To the direct degree that
   <strong>
    clarity of shared purpose
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   and
   <strong>
    principles
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    strength of belief
   </strong>
   in them exist,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   constructive, harmonious behavior may be
   <strong>
    educed
   </strong>
   .
   <br/>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   To the direct degree they do not exist,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   behavior is inevitably
   <strong>
    compelled
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   It is not complicated.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The
   <strong>
    alternative to shared belief in purpose and principles
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   is
   <strong>
    tyranny
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   And tyranny,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   whether petty or grand,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   whether commercial, political, or social,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   is inevitably
   <strong>
    destructive
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dee Hock, closes his argument with the statement
  <br/>
  that should be the Zen
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan">
   Koan
  </a>
  that wake us up
  <br/>
  from the
  <strong>
   delusion of command and control
  </strong>
  that
  <br/>
  is at the root of the assumption that
  <em>
   “Management”
   <br/>
  </em>
  serve any purpose at all, in human organizations:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “People deprived of self-organization
   <br/>
   and self-governance
   <br/>
   are inherently
   <strong>
    ungovernable
   </strong>
   “
