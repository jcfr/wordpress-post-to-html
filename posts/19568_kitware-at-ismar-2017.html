  Kitware presented a half day tutorial on “Developing virtual reality applications with VTK”. The attendees were presented with an introduction to VTK before discovering how to make Virtual Reality applications using VTK’s OpenVR support. Small demonstration applications were presented in different fields of study such as Medical Imaging or Computational Fluid Dynamics.
