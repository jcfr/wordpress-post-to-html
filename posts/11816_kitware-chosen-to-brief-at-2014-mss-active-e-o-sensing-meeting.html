  Kitware  Inc. is pleased to announce they will be participating in this year’s  2014 Meeting of the Military Sensing Symposium (MSS) Specialty Group on  Active E-O Systems, beginning this Tuesday, August 26, 2014.  This  symposium is a three-day event located in Springfield, VA, focusing on  active Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) systems for military,  intelligence, and civil applications. It will be held in tandem with the  MSS Electro-Optical and Infrared Countermeasures Specialty Group  providing technical and strategic information to the combined community  through presentations and detailed discussions. Dr. Rusty Blue, a  Technical Leader in the Computer Vision group within Kitware, will  provide a presentation on “Fusing 3D Point Data and Video for GPS-Denied  Navigation” in the “Active Systems for Surveillance and Reconnaissance”  session on August 27, 2014.  Dr. Blue will address some of the work in  which Kitware has been participating, including Google’s Project Tango,  that have the potential, when combined, to aid the soldier on the ground  in a GPS-Denied environment.
