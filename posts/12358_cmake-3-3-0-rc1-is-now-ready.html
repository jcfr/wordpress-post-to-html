  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the more significant features of CMake 3.3 are:
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "if()" command learned a new "IN_LIST" operator that evaluates
  <br/>
  to true if a given element is contained in a named list.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "add_dependencies()" command learned to allow dependencies to
  <br/>
  be added to *interface libraries*. Dependencies added to an
  <br/>
  interface library are followed transitively in its place since the
  <br/>
  target itself does not build.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "find_library()", "find_path()", and "find_file()" commands
  <br/>
  now search in installation prefixes derived from the "PATH"
  <br/>
  environment variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET" and "VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN"
  <br/>
  target properties now affect compilation in sources of all target
  <br/>
  types.  See policy "CMP0063".
 </p>
 <p>
  * A "&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE" target property and supporting
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE" variable were introduced to tell
  <br/>
  the *Makefile Generators* and the "Ninja" generator to run "include-
  <br/>
  what-you-use" along with the compiler for "C" and "CXX" languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features:
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ctest_build()" and "build_command()" commands no longer tell
  <br/>
  "make" tools to ignore errors with the "-i" option. Previously this
  <br/>
  was done for *Makefile Generators* but not others. See policy
  <br/>
  "CMP0061".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Visual Studio 7" generator (.NET 2002) is now deprecated and
  <br/>
  will be removed in a future version of CMake.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Visual Studio 6" generator is now deprecated and will be
  <br/>
  removed in a future version of CMake.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "add_definitions()" command no longer causes a "DEFINITIONS"
  <br/>
  directory property to be populated. See policy "CMP0059".

   CMake 3.3 Release Notes
   <br/>
   ***********************
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Changes made since CMake 3.2 include the following.
 </p>
 <p>
  New Features
  <br/>
  ============
 </p>
 <p>
  Generators
  <br/>
  ———-
 </p>
 <p>
  * The *Makefile Generators* now add ".DELETE_ON_ERROR" to the
  <br/>
  makefiles that contain the actual build rules for files on disk.
  <br/>
  This tells GNU make to remove rule outputs when their recipe
  <br/>
  modifies an output but fails.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The *Visual Studio Generators* learned to support ".xaml" source
  <br/>
  files and automatically associate them with corresponding ".h" and
  <br/>
  ".cpp" sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  * A new experimental "Green Hills MULTI" generator was added on
  <br/>
  Windows.  Green Hills MULTI is an IDE for embedded real-time
  <br/>
  systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Commands
  <br/>
  ——–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "add_dependencies()" command learned to allow dependencies to
  <br/>
  be added to *interface libraries*. Dependencies added to an
  <br/>
  interface library are followed transitively in its place since the
  <br/>
  target itself does not build.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "execute_process()" command learned to support specifying the
  <br/>
  same file for "OUTPUT_FILE" and "ERROR_FILE".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "file(GLOB)" and "file(GLOB_RECURSE)" commands learned a new
  <br/>
  "LIST_DIRECTORIES &lt;bool&gt;" option to specify whether the glob result
  <br/>
  should include directories.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "find_library()", "find_path()", and "find_file()" commands
  <br/>
  now search in installation prefixes derived from the "PATH"
  <br/>
  environment variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "if()" command learned a new "IN_LIST" operator that evaluates
  <br/>
  to true if a given element is contained in a named list.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install(EXPORT)" and "export()" commands learned to export
  <br/>
  targets that populate the "INTERFACE_SOURCES" target property.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "install(TARGETS)" command learned to support generator
  <br/>
  expressions in the "DESTINATION" value.
 </p>
 <p>
  Variables
  <br/>
  ———
 </p>
 <p>
  * The version of some Fortran compilers is now detected and stored
  <br/>
  in the "CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_VERSION" variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The *Visual Studio Generators* learned a new
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD" option to put the
  <br/>
  "INSTALL" target in the default build of a solution (".sln") file.
 </p>
 <p>
  Properties
  <br/>
  ———-
 </p>
 <p>
  * A "CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR" target property and supporting
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR" variable were introduced to allow
  <br/>
  target platform binaries to run on the host during cross compiling.
 </p>
 <p>
  * A "&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE" target property and supporting
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE" variable were introduced to tell
  <br/>
  the *Makefile Generators* and the "Ninja" generator to run "include-
  <br/>
  what-you-use" along with the compiler for "C" and "CXX" languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET" and "VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN"
  <br/>
  target properties now affect compilation in sources of all target
  <br/>
  types.  See policy "CMP0063".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;" target property learned to
  <br/>
  support generator expressions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Modules
  <br/>
  ——-
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CheckFortranCompilerFlag" module was introduced to check
  <br/>
  "Fortran" compiler flags, much like the "CheckCCompilerFlag" module
  <br/>
  already does for "C".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalData" module learned a new "ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS"
  <br/>
  option to disable use of symbolic links to populate the real data
  <br/>
  files and use copies instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalData" module learned a new "RECURSE:" option in
  <br/>
  "DATA{}" references specifying directories. This allows an entire
  <br/>
  directory tree of associated files to be matched.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalData" module learned a new URL template placeholder
  <br/>
  "%(algo:&lt;key&gt;)" to allow custom mapping from algorithm name to URL
  <br/>
  component through configuration of new
  <br/>
  "ExternalData_URL_ALGO_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;key&gt;" variables. This allows more
  <br/>
  flexibility in remote URLs.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module learned to replace tokens like
  <br/>
  "&lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;" in the "BYPRODUCTS" of each step.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ExternalProject" module APIs learned to support "generator
  <br/>
  expressions" when using "LOG_*" options and in CMake initial cache
  <br/>
  options.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindBoost" module now tracks the directories containing
  <br/>
  libraries separately for RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindCUDA" module now defaults to using the static CUDA
  <br/>
  runtime library if it is available.  A new
  <br/>
  "CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME" option is offered to control this
  <br/>
  behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindMatlab" module was completely rewritten.  It learned
  <br/>
  about versions and components and to find Matlab in a more precise
  <br/>
  and multiplatform way.  The module now offers APIs to create mex
  <br/>
  extensions, documentation, and unit tests.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindPackageHandleStandardArgs" module
  <br/>
  "FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS" function now always populates
  <br/>
  both the "&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND" and "&lt;UPPERCASE_NAME&gt;_FOUND"
  <br/>
  variables (the latter for backwards compatibility).  The "FOUND_VAR"
  <br/>
  option is now ignored except to enforce its allowed values.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "InstallRequiredSystemLibraries" module learned a new
  <br/>
  "CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT" option to specify the
  <br/>
  installation component.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generator Expressions
  <br/>
  ———————
 </p>
 <p>
  * A new "COMPILE_LANGUAGE" generator expression was introduced to
  <br/>
  allow specification of compile options for target files based on the
  <br/>
  "LANGUAGE" of each source file.  Due to limitations of the
  <br/>
  underlying native build tools, this feature has varying support
  <br/>
  across generators.  See the "cmake-generator-expressions(7)" manual
  <br/>
  for details.
 </p>
 <p>
  CTest
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ctest(1)" tool learned a new "–repeat-until-fail &lt;n&gt;" option
  <br/>
  to help find sporadic test failures.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CTestCoverageCollectGCOV" module learned to support the same
  <br/>
  "CTEST_CUSTOM_COVERAGE_EXCLUDE" option as the "ctest_coverage()"
  <br/>
  command.
 </p>
 <p>
  CPack
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cpack(1)" "IFW" generator and the "CPackIFW" module learned
  <br/>
  to support Qt Framework Installer 2.0 tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackDeb" module learned a new
  <br/>
  "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS" variable to specify
  <br/>
  per-component use of "dpkg-shlibdeps".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackDeb" module learned a new
  <br/>
  "CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_DEPENDS" option to specify per-
  <br/>
  component dependencies.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackRPM" module learned to package symbolic links more
  <br/>
  cleanly and now supports directory symlinks with recent "rpmbuild"
  <br/>
  versions.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackRPM" module learned a new
  <br/>
  "CPACK_RPM_ADDITIONAL_MAN_DIRS" variable to specify directories
  <br/>
  containing man pages for the brp- compress RPM macro.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CPackRPM" module learned a new
  <br/>
  "CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE" variable to specify a
  <br/>
  component-specific package architecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The CPack WIX generator learned the new
  <br/>
  "CPACK_START_MENU_SHORTCUTS", "CPACK_DESKTOP_SHORTCUTS" and
  <br/>
  "CPACK_STARTUP_SHORTCUTS" installed file properties which can be
  <br/>
  used to install shorcuts in the Start Menu, on the Desktop and in
  <br/>
  the Startup Folder respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other
  <br/>
  —–
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Compile Features" functionality is now aware of features
  <br/>
  supported by GNU compilers on Windows, versions 4.4 through 5.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "cmake(1)" "-E tar" command learned a new "–format&lt;format&gt;"
  <br/>
  option to specify the archive format to be written.
 </p>
 <p>
  * On OS X, CMake learned to create XCTest bundles to test Frameworks
  <br/>
  and App Bundles within Xcode.  The "FindXCTest" module provides
  <br/>
  convenience functions to handle "XCTEST" bundles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features
  <br/>
  ===============================
 </p>
 <p>
  * On OS X the "cmake-gui(1)" no longer has the "Install For Command
  <br/>
  Line Use" menu item.  Instead there is a "How to Install For Command
  <br/>
  Line Use" menu item that shows an informational dialog box
  <br/>
  explaining how to make the command line tools available.  For
  <br/>
  example:
 </p>
 <p>
  /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui –install
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "ctest_build()" and "build_command()" commands no longer tell
  <br/>
  "make" tools to ignore errors with the "-i" option. Previously this
  <br/>
  was done for *Makefile Generators* but not others. See policy
  <br/>
  "CMP0061".
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Visual Studio 10 2010" generator no longer checks for running
  <br/>
  VS IDEs with the project open or asks them to reload. This was
  <br/>
  originally done for VS 10 because it had been done for VS 7 through
  <br/>
  9 to avoid prompting for every project in a solution. Since VS &gt;= 10
  <br/>
  allow the whole solution to reload at once they do not need CMake to
  <br/>
  help them.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Visual Studio 7" generator (.NET 2002) is now deprecated and
  <br/>
  will be removed in a future version of CMake.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Visual Studio 6" generator is now deprecated and will be
  <br/>
  removed in a future version of CMake.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "find_package()" command no longer considers project build
  <br/>
  trees recently configured in a "cmake-gui(1)". This was previously
  <br/>
  done only on Windows and is now never done. The
  <br/>
  "NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH" option is now ignored if given and
  <br/>
  effectively always on. Projects may populate the *User Package
  <br/>
  Registry* to aid users building multiple dependent projects one
  <br/>
  after another.
 </p>
 <p>
  * When building with GNU tools on Windows (MinGW tools), the
  <br/>
  "find_library()" command will no longer consider ".dll" files to be
  <br/>
  linkable libraries.  All dynamic link libraries are expected to
  <br/>
  provide separate ".dll.a" or ".lib" import libraries.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "add_definitions()" command no longer causes a "DEFINITIONS"
  <br/>
  directory property to be populated. See policy "CMP0059".
 </p>
 <p>
  * With Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9 generators the value of the
  <br/>
  "$(OutDir)" placeholder no longer evaluates to the configuration
  <br/>
  name.  Projects should use "$(ConfigurationName)" for that instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Using the output of "export()" with the "install(FILES)" command
  <br/>
  is no longer allowed.  See policy "CMP0062" for details.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other Changes
  <br/>
  =============
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Ninja" generator now requires that calls to the
  <br/>
  "add_custom_command()" and "add_custom_target()" commands use the
  <br/>
  "BYPRODUCTS" option to explicitly specify any files generated by the
  <br/>
  custom commands that are not listed as outputs (perhaps because
  <br/>
  their timestamps are allowed to be older than the inputs).  See
  <br/>
  policy "CMP0058".
 </p>
 <p>
  * Build-time progress output of *Makefile Generators* has been
  <br/>
  improved. It no longer mixes progress and build rule messages during
  <br/>
  parallel builds. The link rule messages now have progress and are
  <br/>
  displayed as bold green instead of bold red (since red is often
  <br/>
  associated with an error message).
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR" variable value for Visual Studio 7, 8, and
  <br/>
  9 is now "$(ConfigurationName)" instead of "$(OutDir)". This should
  <br/>
  have no effect on the intended use cases of the variable.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Linking to library files by a full path in an implicit linker
  <br/>
  search directory (e.g. "/usr/lib/libfoo.a") no longer asks the
  <br/>
  linker to search for the library (e.g. "-lfoo") and now links by
  <br/>
  full path. See policy "CMP0060".
 </p>
