     For  the 3.10 release,  we have added 60 new readers, which include: ANSYS, CGNS, Chombo, Dyna3D, Enzo, Mili, Miranda, Nastran,  Pixie, Samrai, Silo, and Tecplot Binary. A full listing of supported  readers can be found in the ParaView Users Guide. We also added the  ability for developers to create ParaView reader plugins from previously  developed VisIt reader plugins. You can find a full guide on how to do  this on the

     With  this release we have rewritten the ParaView User’s Guide and are making  it freely available for the first time. The complete guide can be  obtained in the help system or online through the

     We  have included a Python-based calculator which makes it possible to  write operations using Python. The Python calculator uses NumPy, which  lets you use advanced functions such as gradients, curls, and divergence  easily in expressions. Also the NumPy module is packaged in the  ParaView binary and is importable from the ParaView Python shell.

     To  better utilize multiple cores on modern multi-core machines, by default  ParaView can now run using a parallel server, even for the built-in  mode. This enables the use of all the cores for parallel data  processing, without requiring the user to start a parallel server.  ParaView binaries will also be distributed using an MPI implementation,  making this feature available to users by simply downloading the  binaries. Since this is an experimental feature, it is off by default,  but users can turn it on by checking the Auto-MPI checkbox in the  application settings dialog.

     Additionally,  the 3.10 release includes several usability enhancements. 3D View now  supports smart context menus, accessed by right-clicking on any object  in the 3D View to change its color, representation, color map and  visibility. Left-clicking on an object in the 3D View makes it active in  the pipeline browser. Within the spreadsheet view, sorting is now  supported and an advanced parallel sorting algorithm ensures that none  of the benefits of the spreadsheet view, such as streaming and  selection, are sacrificed. Python tracing and macro controls are no  longer hidden on the Python shell dialog and instead are now easily  found on the Tools menu.

     We have improved the rendering pipeline to better handle composite  datasets, which leads to a marked performance improvement for users  dealing with large multi-block datasets.
     <span style="border-collapse: collapse;">
      For  developers interested in adding support for advanced multi-pass  rendering algorithms to ParaView, this release includes a major  refactoring of ParaView’s rendering pipeline. View and representations  have been redesigned and users should see improved performance in  client-server mode from reduced interprocess communication during  rendering.

     LANL’s  MantaView interactive ray tracing plugin has been restructured to make  it easier to use. Version 2.0 of the plugin is now multi-view capable  and no longer requires ParaView to be run in a client/server  configuration. Similarly both of LANL’s streaming aware ParaView derived  applications have been merged into ParaView proper in the form of a new  View plugin. The underlying streaming algorithms have been rewritten to  be more usable and extensible. Both plugins are available in standard  binary package for the first time in this release.
