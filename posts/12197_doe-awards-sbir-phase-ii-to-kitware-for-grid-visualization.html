  Kitware, Inc. has won a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from the DOE to develop a scalable, grid enabled, collaborative visualization environment to support the emerging distributed computing network. Grid computing is viewed by many technologists as a promising software technology to leverage distributed resources across the internet, allowing organizations to utilize distant resources and access remote data. Kitware will develop automation tools for deploying software applications written with VTK (vtk.org) and ITK (itk.org) software systems onto the grid. Currently grid deployment is a diffuclt process requiring significant expertise. Kitwareâ€™s goal is to simplify this process so that engineers and scientists without grid experience can deploy their computational tools with minimal effort.
