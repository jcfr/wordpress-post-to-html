  ActiViz is a family of software products that allow you to embed active visualization tools into documents and applications that support ActiveX controls. Depending on your requirements, you can use Visual Basic, Tcl/Tk, and embeddable ActiveX controls to extend such applications as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Explorer, and Visual Basic. Using ActiViz, you can take advantage of the hundreds of imaging, 3D graphics, and visualization filters available in the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) open-source visualization system.

  ActiViz/TCL is an embeddable control that lets you use VTK (the Visualization Toolkit) wrapped with Tcl inside of Microsoft documents. You can either load external Tcl scripts, or build the scripts into the application. The Tcl control can be embedded into Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Explorer documents. ActiViz/Tcl 1.1 is available for free download a 30-day trial application period.
