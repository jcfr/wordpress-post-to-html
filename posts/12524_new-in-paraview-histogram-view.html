  Newly added to ParaView (and slated to be included in the upcoming ParaView 4.2 release) is a brand new
  <strong>
   Histogram View
  </strong>
  . Histograms are nothing new to ParaView. Using the
  <strong>
   Histogram
  </strong>
  filter and plotting the results in a
  <strong>
   Bar Chart View
  </strong>
  , you could always look at histograms for data arrays. What was lacking was the ablility to then select bins in this histogram and see which data elements those corresponded to.
 </p>
 <p>
  To support this, we added a new
  <strong>
   Histogram View
  </strong>
  . You can show any arbitrary dataset, without the need for apply the
  <strong>
   Histogram
  </strong>
  filter in this view. The view will automatically show the histogram for the selected data array (which you can select using the
  <strong>
   Properties
  </strong>
  panel). These histogram parameters are now available under the
  <strong>
   Display
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  section.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the selection buttons at the top of the view (or the
  <strong>
   S
  </strong>
  key), you can enter selection mode and then click-and-drag to select bins in this view. The selection should then reflect in all other views showing the same dataset including
  <strong>
   Render View
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Plot Matrix View
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Parallel Coordinates View
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   SpreadSheet View
  </strong>
  .
