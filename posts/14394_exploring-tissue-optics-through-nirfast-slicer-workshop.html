  The Optical Society (OSA) Biomedical Optics 2016 conference took place last week in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Prior to the start of the conference, Alexis Girault from Kitware co-taught a

   NIRFAST
  </a>
  . NIRFAST is an open-source software package that researchers use to model multi-wavelength and luminescence light propagation through tissues of arbitrary shapes. At the workshop, Alexis provided instructions and support on

    The goal of the workshop was to help attendees become acquainted with NIRFAST and NIRFAST-Slicer through interactive case studies. The first case study outlined the basic principles of fluorescence imaging. For this case study, attendees used NIRFAST-Slicer to visualize three-dimensional (3D) images that were overlaid on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

    (DICOM) image stack of a mouse. For the second case study, attendees generated a Jacobian matrix for a mesh created from an MRI head scan. For the third and final case study, attendees reconstructed 3D images from segmented optical data.
