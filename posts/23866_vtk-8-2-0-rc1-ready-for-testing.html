  Take a look at the
  <a href="https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/API_Changes_8_1_1_to_8_2_0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   VTK wiki
  </a>
  for a complete list of API changes in v8.2.0 over the previous version.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please try this version of VTK, and report any issues to the
  <a href="https://www.gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   bug tracker
  </a>
  so that we can try to address them before VTK 8.2.0 final. Kindly set the
  <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/milestones/10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   8.2 milestone
  </a>
  on your issue and merge requests for 8.2 to ensure that they are tracked during the remainder of the release process. Further, please base / rebase all 8.2 target branches off of the v8.2.0.rc1 tag to ensure minimal merge conflicts with the release and master branches.
 </p>
 <p>
  The official release notes will be available when VTK 8.2.0 final is finished in the next few weeks. In the meantime, here is a preview of the significant changes and new features:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Support for the TCL, Qt4 and the legacy fixed function OpenGL backend have been dropped. Meanwhile support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 has been deprecated.
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    vtkTestOpenGLVersion.h is a way for applications to test required OpenGL capabilities at startup on Windows and fall back to Mesa software rendering if necessary.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   In Python the new “import vtkmodules” is significantly faster than “import vtk”.
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    The new vtkCellValidator filter identifies buggy cells in datasets, testing for wrong numbers of points, intersecting edges, intersecting faces, noncontiguous edges, nonconvex, and incorrectly oriented faces.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   The new
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    vtkContour3DLinearGrid filter gives ~10-20x or greater speedups or unstructured grids consisting of linear cells.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    Eight VTK-m filters have been exposed into VTK and several VTK-m filters can now run on either CUDA, TBB or OpenMP.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    Filters to extract selections have been revamped to support boolean combinations. The improved vtkExtractSelection filter (the previously implementations is still available as vtkExtractSelectionLegacy) uses a hierarchy of vtkSelector classes to support different types of selections.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   The hardware selector transfers less data between the CPU and GPU. This makes it significantly faster for high resolution meshes.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    The vtkAMReXParticlesReader reads particle data from
   </span>

    <span style="font-weight: 400">
     AMReX
    </span>
   </a>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    plotfiles.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    The vtkOBJImporter has many fixes and improvements in 8.2.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    The new vtkFFMPEGVideoSource decodes video files into images and audio data.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    VTK now supports Oculus touch controllers.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    One can now modify or use custom shaders with the GPU volume mapper to tweak final rendering.
   </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
   <span style="font-weight: 400">
    vtkWeb remote rendering was optimized with a new protocol that minimizes bandwidth.
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>

  We hope you enjoy this release of VTK!
