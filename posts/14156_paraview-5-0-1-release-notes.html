  ParaView 5.0.1 is now available for
  <a href="http://www.paraview.org/download/">
   download
  </a>
  . This is a patch release that addresses some critical issues reported in the 5.0.0 release. Since this is a patch release, users using ParaView in client-server configurations can continue to use a  5.0.0 server with a 5.0.1 client if necessary (but not vice versa), although using 5.0.1 server is highly recommended.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the issues addressed by this release are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Remote rendering with translucent geometry or volume rendering had artifacts due to the image compression algorithm used for delivering rendered images to the client. This is now fixed by adding a new compression algorithm (
   <a href="http://cyan4973.github.io/lz4/">
    LZ4
   </a>
   ). LZ4 is now the default compression algorithm used for delivering images in client-server mode, instead of
   <em>
    SQUIRT
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    ‘Ray Cast Only’
   </em>
   option was accidentally removed from the available volume mapper choices when volume rendering 3D image datasets. This has been fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed
   <em>
    Axes Grid
   </em>
   disappearing when using parallel projection.
  </li>
  <li>
   Arrays from
   <em>
    Field Data
   </em>
   were accidentally being listed in array selection widgets for filters like
   <em>
    Threshold
   </em>
   . Fixed that.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed run-time issues with executing Python scripts generated using ParaView’s tracing capabilities when the pipeline had multiple output ports.
  </li>
  <li>
   Several fixes for volume rendering have gone into this release including fixing issues with volume rendering using cell data arrays.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Besides 64-bit binaries for Linux, OsX and Windows, we have brought back the 32-bit Windows binaries with this release. The 64-bit Windows binaries are available in two flavors: without MPI and with MPI. The binaries with MPI require that
