    Conference Seeks Proposals
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  In a post on the Kitware blog, Stephen Aylward, the senior director of operations – North Carolina at Kitware and an International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) grand challenges chair, advocated for teams to submit proposals for grand challenges for ISBI. The grand challenges aim to advance the field of medical image analysis. Kitware has helped to coordinate the solicitation and the execution of proposals for several years. Aylward noted that the chairs will accept proposal submissions until September 15, 2016.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among other areas of interest, proposals can address the pursuit of new ideas for challenges, the repetition of previous challenges, or the contribution of data. For more information on the proposal-submission process, please read “ISBI 2017: Call for Challenge Proposals” at

    Kitware Runners Finish in Top 10
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  On May 19, 2016, members of Kitware participated in the CDPHP® Workforce Team Challenge. The challenge consisted of a 3.5-mile course. Over 8,000 people gathered in the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza in Albany, New York, for the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the challenge, Jake Stookey, Matt Turek, Bill Hoffman, and Jacob Becker once again represented Kitware in the “Male Team” category. With a time of 1:28:55, they improved their placement from last year and came in 10th. Over 550 teams registered in the category.

    Project Aims to Make Big Strides in Data Management
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware announced plans to kick off development on a Phase II Department of Energy (DOE) Small Business Innovation Research project to simplify Big Data management. For the project, Kitware looks to extend GoBig, its open-source software system that provides Big Data analysts with access to a range of computing resources through a unified interface.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The computational power of the current technological landscape is unprecedented, and Big Data is more complex than ever,” Jeff Baumes, an assistant director of scientific computing at Kitware, said. “GoBig offers analysts in academic, governmental, and commercial settings with a flexible and extensible solution for managing Big Data.”
 </p>
 <p>
  GoBig enables analysts to employ today’s most advanced tools and libraries, yet it does not require that analysts learn several programming languages. The modular design of the system streamlines installation and significantly reduces the costs that come with maintaining multiple computing environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  “GoBig is a self-contained system, so it is easy to set up and configure,” Baumes said. “In addition, as GoBig is open source, it does not impose licensing fees.”
 </p>
 <p>
  GoBig leverages high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) resources, and it builds on components of the Resonant environment. These components include Girder, which provides GoBig with accesses to data from multiple storage systems, and Romanesco, which allows GoBig to manage workflows with different programming languages and computing engines.
 </p>
 <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_15254" style="width: 560px">
  <img alt="kw_flowchart" class="wp-image-15254 size-full" height="244" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart.jpg" srcset="https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart.jpg 550w, https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart-300x133.jpg 300w, https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart-220x98.jpg 220w, https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart-250x111.jpg 250w, https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart-355x157.jpg 355w, https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kw_flowchart-90x40.jpg 90w" width="550"/>
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
   The workflow interface in GoBig combines tasks for different computing architectures. In this case, GoBig writes a word-count frequency in Scala with Spark, and it writes a bar plot in R.
  </p>
 </div>
 <p>
  “With GoBig, analysts no longer need to stick to just one type of data across their respective workflows,” Baumes said. “They are free to harness the power of multiple systems regardless of whether or not these systems share a common technology stack.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During Phase I, the development team at Kitware created the GoBig code repository, which is available on GitHub. The team also tested the GoBig system on use cases in climate analysis and business intelligence. These tests demonstrated the successful execution of GoBig as an end-to-end system.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Phase II, the team will equip GoBig to deploy on the Web. The team will also integrate new technologies with GoBig such as ParaViewWeb, which can run parallel visualization jobs. This integration will widen the scope of GoBig to fields such as simulation and modeling.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The performance of GoBig is encouraging,” Baumes said. “We found that a major advantage of the system is that it uses both HPC and HTC resources, as some scenarios may favor one type of resource over the other.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In developing GoBig through open practices, Kitware is furthering its commitment to promote collaboration and scientific discovery. Since 1998, Kitware has created and supported open-source solutions including CMake, the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), ParaView, and the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).

    Collaborator Presents Joint Work on In Situ Methods
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  E. Wes Bethel from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory presented a paper at EuroVis 2016 that Andrew Bauer, Berk Geveci, and Patrick O’Leary from Kitware co-wrote. The paper details how in situ methods can aid in extreme-scale high-performance computing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bethel discussed the paper in the session on distributed visualization on June 8, 2016. To familiarize EuroVis attendees with the paper, Kitware published the abstract to the work at https://blog.kitware.com/paper-on-in-situ-methods-accepted-for-publication.
