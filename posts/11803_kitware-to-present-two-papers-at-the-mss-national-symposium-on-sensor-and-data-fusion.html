  In “Interactive, Content-Based Exploration of Large Visual Archives through Feature Set Fusion,” Dr. Turek will discuss a novel framework Kitware is developing for visual data search and exploration for social multimedia. The framework combines computer vision, data fusion, and graph-based interactive visualization applied to content commonly found on the web, such as Youtube videos.
