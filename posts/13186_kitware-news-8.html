     Quantifying Lung Cancer Markers
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware has announced a $202,762 STTR award from the National Institutes of Health to develop a computational method for longitudinal image analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project is a collaboration between Kitware and three world-class research institutions: Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), and University of Pittsburgh. It is co-led by Dr. Nathan Cahill of RIT and Dr. Marc Niethammer of UNC Chapel Hill's Department of Computer Science.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over this two-year project, Kitware's research will focus on the continued development of the geometric metamorphosis algorithm that it pioneered with Dr. Niethammer at UNC. This algorithm facilitates longitudinal image analysis by capturing and quantifying pathology-specific changes regarding disease growth and infiltration, while also compensating for background motion in patient scans taken over time. Most current techniques do not distinguish diseases that spread by displacing healthy tissue from diseases that spread by infiltrating healthy tissue; however, distinguishing those types of changes can be vital to disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Furthermore, most current techniques do not de-couple background motion (e.g., respiratory motion) from disease change. Therefore, they provide an imprecise estimate of disease change.
 </p>
 <p>
  While geometric metamorphosis is applicable to the longitudinal study of nearly any type of focal pathology, this project will focus on one of the most challenging and important clinical tasks: the detection and diagnosis of subtle lung lesions that may be pre-cursor to the development of lung cancer. To pursue this clinical goal, the geometric metamorphosis algorithm will be integrated with more accurate models of lung motion developed by Drs. Nathan Cahill and Maria Helguera at RIT. Additionally, Drs. Kyongtae Ty Bae and David Fetzer, Radiology Faculty in the Department of Radiology at the University of Pittsburgh, will provide clinical guidance and data throughout the development and evaluation of these techniques.

     Neurosurgery Simulation Tool for AVMs
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware has announced $1,932,231 in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop and validate its neurosurgery simulation tool for the treatment of arteriovenour malformations (AVMs). This project is a collaborative effort between Kitware, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Arizona State University (ASU), and Professor Nikos Chrisochoides.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cerebral AVMs affect millions of people around the world. The surgical resectioning of AVMs is one of the most complex surgeries involving brain vasculature. Due to the risk and complexity of AVM surgery, neurosurgeons need to be highly trained. The use of a realistic and approach-specific simulator will significantly improve the training process by allowing surgeons to have hands-on experiences without jeopardizing the health of patients.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project's team has extensive expertise in clinical neurosurgical procedures, computational mechanics, computer graphics, meshing algorithms, human factor studies, and real-time simulation. Dr. Suvranu De from RPI, Dr. Dinesh Manocha from UNC, and Dr. Andinet Enquobahrie from Kitware are co-Principal Investigators for the project.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the project, the team of collaborators aims to build a clinically-realistic and well-validated neurosurgical simulator that can effectively model vascular structures and non-linear deformations that occur during the surgical treatment of AVMs. The project's technical development includes anatomical modeling and volumetric meshing of vascular structures. It also involves combining FEM biomechanical modeling with fluid simulation, as well as integrating GPU-based implementations for real-time simulation.

     Kitware Receives Funding to Develop an Open-Source Application using S/TEM
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware has announced a new Department of Energy SBIR Phase I award to develop an open-source platform for materials reconstruction using scanning transmission electron microscopes (S/TEM).
 </p>
 <p>
  Scanning transmission electron microscopes have advanced the state-of-the-art in the field, facilitating the 3D characterization of materials at the nano and mesoscale. The importance of this type of 3D characterization has extended to a wide class of nanomaterials including hydrogen fuel cells, solar cells, industrial catalysts, new battery materials, and semiconductor devices. While there currently exists a large quantity of capable instrumentation, the rapidly expanding demand for high-resolution tomography is bottlenecked by software that is tailored to lower-dose, biological applications rather than higher-resolution, materials applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  To address this bottleneck, Kitware will collaborate with Cornell University on the SBIR project "Open-Source Visualization and Analysis Platform for 3D Reconstructions of Materials by Transmission Electron Microscopy." During Phase I of the project, the team will develop and test a fully functional, freely-distributable, open-source S/TEM package. This package will incorporate a modern user interface that enables the alignment and reconstruction of raw tomography data. The S/TEM package will also provide advanced 3D visualization and analysis that is specifically optimized for materials applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Marcus D. Hanwell, a Technical Leader on Kitware's Scientific Computing team, will serve as the Principal Investigator for the project.

     Locating anatomical structures in ultrasound images
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  In a research effort funded by the National Institutes of Health, Kitware teamed with InnerOptic to develop a new approach to help novice users analyze ultrasound images in order to locate specific anatomical structures. The team's approach is based on developing a set of template video sequences that depict particular anatomical structures captured by an expert user. During an examination, the video sequence created by the novice operator is continually compared to these templates in order to identify the target anatomical structures.
 </p>
 <p>
  One challenge faced by the research team during this effort was access to sample clinical ultrasound video sequences. Although ultrasound images are readily available, the full video sequences are rarely retained. Even if this data did exist, these video sequences would have been captured by an expert operator and, therefore, would not accurately represent a video sequence captured by an inexperienced user. Accordingly, the team created a new, annotated database of ultrasound videos, which were acquired on three different phantom datasets. This ultrasound video database was designed to mimic the challenges of clinical data without having to request that clinicians alter their existing protocol in order to collect this data from patients. This video database has been made publically available in order to help researchers evaluate and compare similar recognition approaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  The team's research was recently published in the October issue of Medical Image Analysis. In addition, the team has released the detection algorithm as part of the open-source software package TubeTK.

     Pathology Visions 2014 Best Poster
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the 2013 Pathology Visions conference in San Antonio, Texas, Kitware's digital pathology work was recognized in Sharon E. Fox's poster "Remote Eye-Tracking for Quantitative Assessment of Whole Slide Image Viewing." Dr. Fox's poster, which was co-authored by Dr. Charles Law at Kitware Inc. and Dr. Beverly E. Faulkner-Jones at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, won Best Poster by a Resident. Kitware's digital pathology work, led by Dr. Law, was leveraged for the client-server digital pathology system and supported fast web-based viewing over standard networks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The poster details how advanced digital image software can be used to aid pathologists. For the research, Dr. Fox used a Tobii T-120 eye tracker and a client-server digital pathology system to analyze subconscious patterns of gaze and attention as pathologists viewed digital whole slide images (WSI). The patterns help researchers understand how pathologists interact with WSI software, including various interface options, as part of the diagnostic decision making process.
