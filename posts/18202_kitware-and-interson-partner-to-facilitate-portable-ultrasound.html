  Kitware became an approved systems integrator for Interson ultrasound probes. Kitware established years of experience with the probes through projects for medical imaging research, commercial consulting and open-source software development.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Interson is very happy to feature Kitware as a trusted integration partner for our USB ultrasound arrays,” said Interson’s Director of Systems Integration Bill Wiedemann. “Like many others, Interson has relied on Kitware and Kitware solutions over the past seven years.”

  For a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Kitware and its team
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-leading-edge-ultrasound-research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   used Interson probes
  </a>
  to construct a proof of concept of a point-of-care ultrasound system. The team proposed the system to complement first responders as they locate internal bleeding on scene. The grant work applied a signal analysis algorithm that Kitware pioneered for tissue identification. Through follow-on work, the team intends to complete the system to intelligently assist first responders with probe placement, image interpretation and injury recognition.

  “Point-of-care ultrasound systems that combine ultrasound probes with innovative machine learning algorithms and customized user interfaces will revolutionize in-field triage, in-home care and in-hospital monitoring,” said

  , Ph.D., the Kitware senior director of strategic initiatives. “Interson probes provide the portability and advanced imaging capabilities at the price point that these systems require.”

  on point-of-care ultrasound for this year’s Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference. The workshop will include presentations and demonstrations that cover a variety of topics such as in-field assessment of traumatic brain injury and intuitive ultrasound guidance through augmented reality.
