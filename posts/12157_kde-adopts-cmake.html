  CMake, Kitware’s open-source software process and build tool, is used throughout the world in a variety of software systems. KDE 4.0, a Linux desktop environment and one of the world’s largest open-source software systems, was recently released across multiple computer platforms due in large part CMake’s cross-platform capabilities.

  . This is the next cutting-edge version of KDE, consisting of the KDE libraries, the workspace (desktop, start panel, window manager), and applications (such as kOffice, kDevelop, etc.). One of the major features of KDE 4 is that it now runs natively on Mac OSX and on Windows, beyond the previous Linux platforms. Such cross-platform support is now possible in major part because KDE is now built using CMake, the cross-platform build, test, package and software process tool

 <p>
  CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system comprised of a family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.
