  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   We see the blending of ParaView, Resonant, VTK, and ITK, as demonstrated by ParaView Glance, as an extremely powerful combination of tools for creating streamlined user experiences in the fields of medicine, computer vision, scientific computing and data analytics.  Each of those components is the product of tens of thousands of hours of software development by experts at Kitware and around the world. Their coordinated integration by Kitware provides value that extends far beyond those individual efforts.
