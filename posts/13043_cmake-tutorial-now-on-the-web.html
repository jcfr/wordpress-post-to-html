  The online documentation for
  <a href="http://www.cmake.org">
   CMake
  </a>
  has just been augmented with the posting of an except from
  <a href="https://www.kitware.com/what-we-offer/#books">
   Mastering CMake
  </a>
  . The code for the tutorial found in chapter 12 has long been available as part of CMake’s
  <a href="http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/Tests/Tutorial/?root=CMake">
   source tree
  </a>
  .  However, the complete text for the tutorial has now been made available to the CMake community. The tutorial can be found
  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html">
   here
  </a>
  , it covers basic CMake usage including testing and dashboard creation.

  New users of CMake will most likely want to look at the following links first:

  As always, I (and a bunch of other folks) will be watching the
  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/mailing.html">
   CMake mailing list
  </a>
  , so if you get stuck, don’t be afraid to post questions on the list.
