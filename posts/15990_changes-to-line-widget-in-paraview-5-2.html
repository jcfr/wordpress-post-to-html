  New features have been added to the line widget to make it easier to use.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The line representation has a cone at the second endpoint to denote direction. This feature is useful for cases like “plot over line”, where the direction of the line matters.
  </li>
  <li>
   Translation of the line and the endpoints can be restricted to be along the x, y or z axis by pressing the ‘X’, ’Y’ or ’Z’ keys while dragging the mouse.
  </li>
  <li>
   The endpoints can be placed by moving the mouse pointer to the desired location and pressing the ‘1’ or ‘2’ keys. To snap the points to the nearest input mesh points use ‘Ctrl+1’ and ‘Ctrl+2’.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  These feature are demonstrated in the following video. They will be available in ParaView 5.2.
