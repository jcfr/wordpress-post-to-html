    Kitware  has been awarded $181,700 in sub-recipient funding on a grant from the  U.S. National Center of Research Resources, part of the National  Institutes of Health (NIH). The funding will be used to make  enhancements to 3D Slicer, an open-source platform for medical image  segmentation, registration, visualization, and analysis. 3D Slicer is  funded by grants associated with the National Alliance for Medical Image  Computing (NA-MIC) and the Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC), and  supported by extensive user and developer communities.

    Dr.  Stephen Aylward, Director of Medical Imaging at Kitware, will act as  Principle Investigator and Julien Finet will act as the lead architect  and developer on this project. They will lead the collaboration between  Kitware and the NIH-NCRR, Slicer, NA-MIC, and NAC communities to extend  Slicer in three critical ways: with a simplified user interface, the  implementation of fully-automated user interface testing, and the  addition of SimpleITK access through Python.

   The  development of a simplified user interface will reduce the amount of  training required for the most common tasks in Slicer. This effort will  minimize the learning curve for end-users; simplify the development of  extensions to the user interface for new algorithms; facilitate more  frequent use of Slicer; and address time-consuming components to allow  for more training time on advanced topics.
