     International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2018
    </a>
    was held April 4-7 in Washington, DC.  In 2017, ISBI hosted 15 papers on ultrasound research.  At this year’s ISBI, ultrasound research was featured in a tutorial, 7 invited presentations, and 25 poster and podium presentations!  Ultrasound is infiltrating nearly every aspect of patient care: providing new diagnostic tests, generating new insights, reducing costs, and improving outcomes.

    <li>
     Uses a 3D UNet architecture to identify skulls in fetal ultrasound images.  It contains extra heuristics (e.g., distance map and shadow map computations) in order to fill-in the skull segments that are tangential to the ultrasound signal lines and thereby don’t appear as hyperechogenic voxels.

     Goal is automating the quantification of ovarian volume on 3D transvaginal ultrasound.  Deep learning provides an energy map for level set segmentation. UNet network generates energy map after being trained to produce binary segmentations.  Evaluated using 50 volumes (1500 radial slices). Dice and volume measurements were compared with experts.

     Features from b-mode and doppler images are extracted by SIFT filters and by (transfer learning) CNNs, those features are summarized using Fisher vector encodings, and those encodings are then processed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to generate a grade of placental maturity.  Various networks, feature combinations, and Fisher kernels are compared. 212 image pairs are split 80/20 for training/testing.
