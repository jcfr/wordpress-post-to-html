  Paraview’s
  <strong>
   Bounding Ruler
  </strong>
  filter has for some time been able to measure the X, Y, or Z axis of the axis-aligned bounding box of a data set. With ParaView 5.6, the
  <strong>
   Bounding Ruler
  </strong>
  filter will now be able to measure the major, medium, and minor axes of a data set’s oriented bounding box. These axes are available as new options in the
  <strong>
   Axis
  </strong>
  property of the
  <strong>
   Bounding Ruler
  </strong>
  filter.
 </p>
 <p>
  An oriented bounding box is a rectangular prism that fits tightly around a data set. To fit tightly, the oriented bounding box may be rotated arbitrarily. Because the axes of the box do not correspond to the axes of the X, Y, and Z axes of the Cartesian coordinate system in which the data set is defined, we name the axes of the bounding box “major” (the longest side), “minor” (the shortest side) and “medium” (the side that is neither longest or shortest).

  These new axes can be useful in cases where you want to measure an object that is not oriented along the standard Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes. For example, set the
  <strong>
   Axis
  </strong>
  property to “Oriented Bounding Box Major Axis” to measure the length of an arbitrarily oriented cylindrical data set as demonstrated below (the red cube that the cylinder passes through is aligned with the Cartesian axes to show the orientation of the cylinder).

  As another example, one can use ParaView’s selection capabilities and the
  <strong>
   Extract Selection
  </strong>
  filter to extract two points of interest. Applying the
  <strong>
   Bounding Ruler
  </strong>
  filter with the
  <strong>
   Axis
  </strong>
  property set to “Oriented Bounding Box Major Axis” to measure the distance between these points. This measurement will automatically update if the points move over time.

 <p>
  One caveat to these new options is that all the points in a data set need to be copied to a single rank to compute the oriented bounding box. When used with a data set distributed over ranks in a parallel
  <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">
   pvserver
  </span>
  , this may be slow or lead to memory exhaustion if the data set does not fit onto one rank.
