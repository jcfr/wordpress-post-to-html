  In this Phase I SBIR awarded by the Army Research Lab, Kitware will develop a mobile ad hoc network platform for ingestion, processing, and visualization of network simulation and scenario data. This platform will be based on an open-source, extensible system. The proposed technology will integrate statistics algorithms; use graph algorithms from the Boost Graph Library; and will make use of the open-source Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and OverView, an application designed to support informatics analysis and visualization methods.
