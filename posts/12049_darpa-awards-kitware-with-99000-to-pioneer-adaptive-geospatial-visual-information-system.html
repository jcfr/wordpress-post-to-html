   Research to increase safety and effectiveness of missions by improving battlefield information delivery
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kitware has received a $99,000 grant from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop an adaptive geospatial visual information system that will improve the dissemination of knowledge contained in data sources through the configuration of data preferences and density preference.
 </p>
 <p>
  The core of Kitware’s research will focus on overcoming suboptimal data access due to either network or device constraints and allowing for adaption to individual cognitive preferences.  Individual users will be able to select and prioritize their desired data sources and adjust the parameters for visual information density of the display based upon preference, network, or the capabilities of their web-enabled device.  Data feed preferences are then saved within a user profile to allow for automatic future adjustment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The research has vast battlefield applications.  Network and device constraints pose significant hurdles to information delivery, and often, stress and environment impact an individual soldier’s ability to process information.  A visual information system with the capability to deliver high-fidelity, nuanced visualizations at higher densities for study at the granular level as well as low-density consequential knowledge with simplified visualizations and alerts will increase safety and effectiveness of military missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Phase I of the project is intended to be completed in six months and focus on overcoming the immense technical challenges, the most significant being producing informative, high-resolution visualizations limited to the capabilities of low-density, web-enabled mobile devices.  Phase II will address more involved visualization techniques to accelerate the search of large document collection.
 </p>
 <p>
  The awarded contract will expand Kitware’s leadership in the field of advanced military research, open source technology and visualization systems.  DARPA has previously commissioned Kitware to research recognition of functional patterns and complex multi-agent activities in video.
