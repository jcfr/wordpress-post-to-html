  today, made two weeks after Tomviz 1.2.0 was released. The 1.2.1 release fixes a few minor bugs discovered at the

  short course following the workshop at Berkeley Lab where we presented a Tomviz tutorial on Wednesday afternoon. This release was made in part to support the short course. We are also planning to make bigger changes in our development branch, and anticipate a longer delay between this release and the next while we make significant architectural changes to the data processing pipeline. This is part of our DoE SBIR Phase IIB project to support the wider tomography user community.

  The 1.2 release improved support for units in MRC and EMD file formats, significantly simplified the binary file reading dialog, and added support for searching for external Python operators (initially in ~/.tomviz, and now in 1.2.1 also in ~/tomviz). We added support for saving the output of visualization modules such as the surface mesh or slice image, and added support for bypassing the lookup table when visualizing data. The view menu had lost some options, which were restored in 1.2.1, along with fixes for packaging on macOS and Linux.
