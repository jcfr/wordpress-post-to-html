  elaborates on a clear example of why
  <strong>
   reproducibility
   <br/>
  </strong>
  must  be a practical requirement for scientific publications, and how
  <br/>
  <strong>
   open-data
  </strong>
  an
  <strong>
   open-code
  </strong>
  are essential to make reproducibility verification
  <br/>
  a practical reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the case of a team at MD Anderson led by Keith Baggerly, that went out an try to replicate the results of a
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v12/n11/abs/nm1491.html">
   set of papers
  </a>
  published by a research group at Duke University. To their surprise, the Baggerly team was unable to replicate the results disclosed in the original papers, and thanks to the fact that most of the data and software was
  <strong>
   publicly available
  </strong>
  , they were able to perform “Forensics” on the papers and discover that they were plagued with poor practices, inconsistent management of data, and unexplicable results.
 </p>
 <p>
  This forensics work led to the
  <a href="http://dukechronicle.com/article/suspended-cancer-trials-terminated">
   termination of clinical trials at Duke
  </a>
  last November and the
  <a href="http://dukechronicle.com/article/anil-potti-duke-cancer-researcher-accused-misconduct-resigns">
   resignation of Anil Potti
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the interesting aspects of this case, is the fact that the forensics team had to use the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_%28United_States%29">
   Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
  </a>
  in order to get an investigation report that Duke sent to the
  <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/">
   National Cancer Institute
  </a>
  . Duke refuse to share that report with the forensic team under the argument that it was “confidential” information. However, given that NCI is a federal agency, is subject to comply with the Freedom of Information Act.
