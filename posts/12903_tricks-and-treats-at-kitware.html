  With Halloween falling on a Monday, the Kitware team was encouraged to take part and dress up for the office. A handful of Kitwareans got into the spirit and dressed up as some very frightening characters! (They also stopped by the candy bowls in the event trick-or-treating later that evening didn’t go so well). See some of our Kitwareans in costume below.

  It wasn’t all treats though; there was a fair amount of tricking as well. Marcus Hanwell found that out first hand when he returned from traveling – his office had been mysteriously transformed into a TARDIS!
