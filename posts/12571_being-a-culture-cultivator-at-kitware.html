    10 years – Wow has time passed quickly.  Who would have imagined a little hobby of mine would bring a new culture to Kitware?

    Making baby blankets for Kitware babies began when our CFO had his 2
    <sup>
     nd
    </sup>
    daughter.  As a thank you for a behemoth of a television that was offered to any employee that wanted it, I picked up my old hobby and crocheted a baby blanket for his little girl.

    Little did I know at that time, Kitware would exponentially grow beyond anyone’s imagination. As the total of Kitware’s employees grew, so did their families. It has been a joy and great pleasure to welcome each new member of the Kitware family with their own unique baby blanket.

    As I saw my 10 year anniversary approaching, I counted up the actual number of blankets made and gifted to my fellow employees.

     50

    and counting… And many memories with all my fellow Kitwareans.
