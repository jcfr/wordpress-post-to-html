  Kitware is very pleased to  announce the award of $296,676 in NIH Phase I STTR funding for the  development of new neuroimage processing methods for the assessment and  improved treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Nearly 1.7 million Americans suffer TBI annually as a result of car  accidents, blunt trauma, gunshots, military combat, and other head  traumas. Many who experience TBI require surgical intervention, and in  some cases, require daily assistance for years post-injury. Healthcare  costs associated with current TBI treatment exceed $60 billion a year;  however, existing analytic assessment methods fall short of clinical  need. Clinicians require informative metrics and easy-to-use image  analysis tools capable of handling large, heterogeneous pathologies that  cause severe brain deformations.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  To address these critical needs, Kitware will collaborate with Dr.  Marc Niethammer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Dr.  Jack Van Horn at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The  team will leverage computational methods for segmenting, registering,  and interpreting images that contain large and changing pathologies to  better characterize injury, quantify longitudinal changes, predict  outcomes, and support patient treatment management. At Kitware, Stephen  Aylward, Senior Director of Operations, North Carolina, is the Principal  Investigator; he will work closely with Project Leader Danielle Pace, a  Research and Development Engineer at Kitware.

  The team will perform multimodal brain image segmentation for the  assessment of acute and chronic TBI for measuring damage over a period  of time; develop a new deformable image registration method for  identifying acute and chronic TBI and change measurement; and  investigate novel TBI metrics for predicting outcomes and guiding  clinical decision making using multivariate statistics. The resulting  software will be delivered to clinicians and made freely available for  widespread use and future extension within the open-source 3D Slicer  application (

  ).

  “We are thrilled to have the opportunity to address such a critical  medical need,” said Danielle Pace, Project Leader. “Through our  exploration of TBI and new analytical and statistical methods for better  understanding its effects across groups of individuals over time,  clinicians will be empowered to more easily examine patient-specific  profiles of TBI and make more informed decisions in regards to  treatment.”
