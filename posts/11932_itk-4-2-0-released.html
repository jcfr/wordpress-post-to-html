  On behalf of the ITK community, we are pleased to announce the release of the Insight Toolkit 4.2.0. This is the second release since ITK4.0 and features several improvements.
 </p>
 <p>
  A number of compiler challenges were addressed and compiler support was improved. ITK now supports the latest GCC 4.7.0, as well as Visual Studio 10 without requiring any workarounds. The team also added GPU modules for Finite Difference, Smoothing, Thresholding, and Registration. The new patch-based denoising filter improves noise reduction by calculating and applying parameters locally, thus accommodating noise variations within an image.

 <p>
  The infrastructure to support

  was added along with a new physics-based non-rigid registration technique. There are numerous other registration V4 enhancements included in the ITK 4.2.0 release as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  This release also welcomed five new contributors with merged patches: Dave Chen, Marc Bruce, Michael Jeulin-L, Ren-Hui Gong, and T.R. Shashwath.Â  If you would like to get involved as part of the ITK community, please join the
