   we discuss four medical simulation applications that use iMSTK.

  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Camera Navigation
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  The camera navigation simulator trains users to master the use of laparoscopic cameras in operating rooms. It is designed to help them improve their skills in endoscopic operations, spatial awareness, and camera positioning. As the video shows, the simulator arranges targets in a circle and overlays an alignment pattern on the camera lens. Users must match the pattern with each target. They can manipulate the position and orientation of the camera through tilt movements, camera head rotation, and scope angulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   We built the camera navigation simulator entirely on iMSTK, with the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) as the rendering backend. iMSTK’s Hardware module tracks the tip of the endoscope through a haptic device interface. The

     CameraController
    </span>
   </span>
   class uses the tracking data to drive VTK’s camera object. Further, the simulator leverages VTK’s utilities for 2D and 3D projections to compute performance metrics. At the end of the task, users are presented with visualizations of the camera path and values from various metric calculations. For additional reading, please see our related work, which was published in Surgical Endoscopy [1].

 <h2>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Osteotomy Trainer
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   The osteotomy trainer simulates
  </span>
  the bone cutting aspect that is common to many procedures such as bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) and temporal bone surgery. More specifically, the trainer simulates the cut of the bone under an oscillating blade saw at high speeds. The fully immersive VR experience is made possible through the VTK rendering backend in iMSTK.
 </p>
 <p>
  iMSTK’s Hardware module supports the GeoMagic Touch device, through which the blade saw is tracked and the forces are rendered.
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   The topological changes that result from the cut are implemented using VTK’s visibility functionality. Please read “High Fidelity Virtual Reality Orthognathic Surgery Simulator” [2] for more details.

 <h2>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Kidney Biopsy Virtual Trainer
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   We developed Kidney Biopsy Virtual Trainer (KBVTrainer)
  </span>
  to help clinicians improve procedural skill competence in real-time ultrasound-guided renal biopsy. In the process
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   , we interfaced iMSTK and 3D Slicer for the first time.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   As the flowchart below shows, iMSTK’s Hardware module tracks the haptic device in the trainer workspace. 3D Slicer handles the magnetic tracking through its integration with the Plus library. iMSTK computes the kidney tissue deformation and its interaction with the needle, passing the information to 3D Slicer at every rendering frame. The transmitted data includes volumetric nodal deformation and forces on the needle. 3D Slicer displays the deformed kidney overlay using its rendering window. To learn about the research methodology, please read “Towards an advanced virtual ultrasound-guided renal biopsy trainer” [3].

 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   We will continue to support the developers and end users of iMSTK. In the coming years, for example, we will work to broaden the scope of the applications that are possible with iMSTK. In order to realize this, we will interface iMSTK with 3D Slicer (in a comprehensive manner),
   <a href="https://physiology.kitware.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Pulse

   physiology engine and
   <a href="https://www.computationalmodelbuilder.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Computational Model Builder
   </a>
   . These are all open source software that we lead in developing and maintaining. In addition, we plan to add critical features to iMSTK such as parallel architecture and advanced collision handling algorithms.
