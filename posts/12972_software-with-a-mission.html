  Following the very good advice of Brandon Whitcher, I started recently reading the book:
  <br/>
  <strong>
   <em>
    <br/>
    <a href="http://www.springer.com/statistics/computanional+statistics/book/978-0-387-75935-7">
     “Software for Data Analysis: Programming with R”
    </a>
   </em>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  by John Chambers
 </p>
 <p>
  I must admit that from the title, and from knowing that this is a book about how to use software for performing statistical analysis, I was expecting a very slow paced, dry and abstract book.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, however, I found a profoundly philosophical and strongly motivational book.
  <br/>
  John Chambers sets up a perfectly aligned rationale to introduce us to the
  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">
   <strong>
    R
   </strong>
   system
  </a>
  and its features.
 </p>
 <p>
  It all starts with having a
  <strong>
   PURPOSE !
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Chambers puts it clearly as:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   DATA EXPLORATION
  </strong>
  is our
  <strong>
   MISSION
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <br/>
   “We and those who use our software want to find new paths to understand the data and the underlying processes.”
   <br/>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_no_man_has_gone_before">
    “The mission is, indeed, to boldly go where no one has gone before”
   </a>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  “…but, we need boldness to be balanced by our responsibility…”
