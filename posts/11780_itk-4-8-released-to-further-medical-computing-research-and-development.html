   Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
  </a>
  (ITK) community, Kitware is pleased to announce the release of ITK  4.8.0. This is a major release that offers substantial benefits to the  medical computing community by making the toolkit more accessible to  non-C++ programmers and by providing greater availability on mobile,  high-performance computing (HPC), and web-browser platforms. The release  includes several improvements to ITK in regards to Python wrapping,  infrastructure, filtering, registration, and documentation. It also  includes new remote modules, third-party library updates, advanced  compiler support, and enhanced code coverage.
 </p>
 <p>
  A key highlight of the release is the  introduction of a Python-wrapping infrastructure based on
  <a href="https://github.com/CastXML/CastXML">
   C-family  Abstract Syntax Tree XML Output
  </a>
  (CastXML). This infrastructure works  with the latest Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC), Clang, and GNU Compiler  Collection (GCC) compilers. Also introduced in the release is  itk::FFTPadImageFilter, which automatically pads images for the greatest  prime factor supported by the fast Fourier transform (FFT)  implementation.
 </p>
 <p>
  ITK 4.8 presents new remote modules including  BridgeNumPy, LabelErodeDilate, ParabolicMorphology, and  MinimalPathExtraction; and more modules can be built as shared  libraries. The 4.8 release also features enhanced point set registration  capabilities, along with experimental cross-compilation support for  Windows (MinGW-w64), ARMv6 (Raspberry Pi), ARMv7 (Android), ppc64le  (POWER8), and JavaScript (Emscripten).
 </p>
 <p>
  ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system  that provides developers from around the world with an extensive suite  of software tools for image analysis. Since development through extreme  programming methodologies began in 1999, ITK has delivered leading-edge  algorithms for processing multidimensional MRI, CT, ultrasound, PET,  fluoroscopy, and microscopy data.
