  Some of the more significant features of CMake 3.2 are:
 </p>
 <p>
  * CMake learned to support unicode characters *encoded as UTF-8* on
  <br/>
  Windows.  This was already supported on platforms whose system APIs
  <br/>
  accept UTF-8 encoded strings. Unicode characters may now be used in
  <br/>
  CMake code, paths to source files, configured files such as ".h.in"
  <br/>
  files, and other files read and written by CMake.  Note that because
  <br/>
  CMake interoperates with many other tools, there may still be some
  <br/>
  limitations when using certain unicode characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "Compile Features" functionality is now aware of features
  <br/>
  supported by more compilers, including:
 </p>
 <p>
  * Apple Clang ("AppleClang") for Xcode versions 4.4 though 6.1.
 </p>
 <p>
  * GNU compiler versions 4.4 through 5.0 on UNIX and Apple ("GNU").
 </p>
 <p>
  * Microsoft Visual Studio ("MSVC") for versions 2010 through 2015.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Oracle SolarisStudio ("SunPro") version 12.4.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "add_custom_command()" and "add_custom_target()" commands
  <br/>
  learned a new "BYPRODUCTS" option to specify files produced as side
  <br/>
  effects of the custom commands.  These are not outputs because they
  <br/>
  do not always have to be newer than inputs.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "file(GENERATE)" command can now generate files which are used
  <br/>
  as source files for buildsystem targets.  Generated files
  <br/>
  automatically get their "GENERATED" property set to "TRUE".
 </p>
 <p>
  Deprecated and Removed Features:
 </p>
 <p>
  * Files written in the "cmake-language(7)", such as "CMakeLists.txt"
  <br/>
  or "*.cmake" files, are now expected to be encoded as UTF-8.  If
  <br/>
  files are already ASCII, they will be compatible.  If files were in
  <br/>
  a different encoding, including Latin 1, they will need to be
  <br/>
  converted.
 </p>
 <p>
  * The "FindOpenGL" module no longer explicitly searches for any
  <br/>
  dependency on X11 libraries with the "FindX11" module.  Such
  <br/>
  dependencies should not need to be explicit. Applications using X11
  <br/>
  APIs themselves should find and link to X11 libraries explicitly.
