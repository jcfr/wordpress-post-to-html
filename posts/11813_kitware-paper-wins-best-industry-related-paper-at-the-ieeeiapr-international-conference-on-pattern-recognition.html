  Kitware is developing a suite of large-scale multimedia analysis tools to advance visual content understanding, content-based search, online privacy protection, and network modeling. As  detailed in the paper, these tools incorporate the latest techniques in multimedia analysis to detect objects, scenes, activities, in-scene text, and audio signals embedded in unconstrained images and videos. Then, patterns in behavior are detected with respect to images on Reddit.com through a unique approach based on two behavioral modes: “supply” and “consumption.” Supply is defined as posting multimedia content, and consumption includes commenting on or interacting with previously posted multimedia content. Users were characterized based on the types of images they consumed and supplied.

  The results of this research offer several new findings to the field of social multimedia analysis. For one, it was observed that the types of images that many users supplied differed from those they consumed. This challenges the previously held notion that users are likely to post and comment on similar images. The paper also shows how to quantify and track the content-based behavior of users over time, revealing changes in their patterns. In addition, a significant proportion (15%) of users supplied more images than they consumed.
