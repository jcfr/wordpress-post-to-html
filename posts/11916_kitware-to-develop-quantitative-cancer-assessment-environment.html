  Kitware today announces the award of $298,436 in Phase I SBIR funding from  the National Institutes of Health. The funding will be used to develop  an ultrasound-based quantitative diagnostic approach for assessing tumor  malignancy and predicting tumor outcomes.

  Ultrasound is commonly used for anatomical imaging and blood flow  measurements because it is relatively low cost and portable, provides  real-time images, and is safe to use.  However,  ultrasound has limited  utility in cancer assessment because aside from tumor size measurement,  it lacks the quantitative diagnostic capabilities necessary for  determining tumor malignancy.

  In this Phase I project, Kitware and researchers from the University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will develop a quantitative,  non-invasive diagnostic approach to assessing tumor growth and treatment  outcomes using ultrasound. The team will first leverage a new  dual-frequency ultrasound probe and a microbubble contrast agent that  work together to enable the rapid acquisition of high-contrast and  high-resolution 3D images of microscopic blood vessels in and around  tumors. Second, building upon Kitware’s TubeTK software library, the  team will investigate algorithms for assessing tumor malignancy and  response to therapy by evaluating morphological characteristics of those  microvessels. Kitware’s prior work involving MRI suggests that  microvascular metrics are reliable predictors of tumor malignancy and  response to therapy.  This research may ultimately  provide clinicians  with an inexpensive, safe, and highly-effective  diagnostic tool for the  quantitative assessment of cancer.

  “We are excited to continue our work with UNC on the development of  quantitative disease assessment techniques based on vascular morphology.   The extension of that work to the novel ultrasound imaging system  developed by Dr. Paul Dayton and Ryan Gessner at UNC has outstanding  potential,” said Stephen Aylward, Senior Director of Operations in North  Carolina at Kitware and Principal Investigator on this project. “The  resulting portability and reliability offered by this approach makes it a  candidate for being a first-choice modality for clinicians in  communities worldwide.”
