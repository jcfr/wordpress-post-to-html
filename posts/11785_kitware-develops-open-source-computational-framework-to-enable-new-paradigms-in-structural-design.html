   DoD-funded project will address issues in modeling behavior of materials.

  Kitware announced Department of Defense (DoD) funding today to  develop an open-source, distributed computational environment for  virtual materials exploration to address a pressing need in the  manufacturing community. Currently, manufacturers that heavily leverage  advanced materials engineering are limited in their abilities to  efficiently and inexpensively design precision parts. As a result, there  is a great need for new paradigms in structural design that leverage  best-of-breed tools from finite element analysis and materials  simulation codes.

  “There now exist simulation codes that are able to predict materials properties with increasing levels of accuracy,”

  the project’s Principal Investigator and a Technical Leader on  Kitware’s Scientific Computing team, said. “Adopting more advanced  materials simulation would ultimately enable the structural design  process to drive materials requirements, with the possibility of  real-time materials exploration, composite design, and/or processing  options that could be adjusted alongside conventional optimization  strategies such as varying shape to accommodate load/rigidity  requirements.”

  The open-source framework will enable designers to move beyond  materials as fixed design inputs to active variables that can be  manipulated as part of the structural design process. This has the  potential to result in a paradigm shift from whole-part design based on  standard material properties tables to the use of actual variables in  dynamic, active material design. The framework will also allow designers  to explore materials and compositions in real time and to adjust  parameters to accommodate specific requirements.

  “Once designers begin to incorporate advanced materials models, it  becomes possible to tailor designs to increase longevity or reduce the  weight of a part without compromising structural integrity,” Hanwell  said. “For example, advanced designs might specify advanced materials  processing techniques such as heat treatments in specific regions to  increase local performance without the added cost of manufacturing the  entire part out of an expensive material.”

 <p>
  To advance materials simulation, Kitware’s experts in finite element  modeling (FEM) and finite element analysis (FEA) will research and  prototype a multiscale simulation environment that integrates advanced  materials models with a classical finite element analysis system for  modeling complex systems. For this Phase I SBIR project funded by the  DoD, the team will investigate different approaches using software as a  rapid prototyping/research tool to critically assess the benefits and  costs of each approach.
