  The Editorial in the February 11
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  Issue of Science (
  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">
   www.sciencemag.org
  </a>
  ), is marking a line on the sand to make clear that the
  <strong>
   REPRODUCIBILITY
  </strong>
  requirement of the scientific method
  <strong>
   IMPLIES
  </strong>
  that data and source code
  <strong>
   MUST
  </strong>
  be made available at the time of publishing scientific results.

  Here are some essential quotes from the Editorial

   “Making Data Maximally Available”
  </a>
  by Brooks Hanson, Andrew Sugden and Bruce Alberts:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   First, the essence:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “It is obvious that making data widely available is an essential element of scientific research.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Second, the challenge:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “The scientific community strives to meet its basic responsibilities toward transparency, standardization and data archiving […] yet scientists are struggling with the huge amount, complexity, and variety of the data that are now being produced.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Third, the Commitment:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Science policy for some time has been that ALL DATA NECESSARY to understand, assess, and extend the conclusions of the manuscript must be available to ANY reader of Science (see
   <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo">
    www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo
   </a>
   ) “
