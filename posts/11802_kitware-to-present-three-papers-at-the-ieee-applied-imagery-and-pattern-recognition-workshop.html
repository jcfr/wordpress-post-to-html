  Kitware, Inc., is pleased to announce it will present three papers at the
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/events/the-ieee-applied-imagery-and-pattern-recognition-workshop/">
   IEEE Applied Imagery and Pattern Recognition Workshop
  </a>
  , October 14-16, 2014 in Washington, DC. It aims “to bring together researchers from government, industry, and academia in an elegant setting conducive to technical interchange across a broad range of disciplines.” Dr. Anthony Hoogs, Kitware’s Senior Director of Computer Vision, will give the three oral presentations at the workshop.

  In “Multi-Target Tracking in Video with Adaptive Integration of Appearance and Motion Models,” Dr. Hoogs will discuss a hybrid tracking architecture that utilizes motion detections to robustly initialize multiple tracks. The tracking architecture also uses a blended approach to integrate appearance-based trackers, provides a generalized API for interfacing such trackers, and adaptively uses motion detection or appearance match to update a track. The paper is authored by
