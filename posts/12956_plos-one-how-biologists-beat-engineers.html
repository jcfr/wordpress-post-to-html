  One of the
  <strong>
   most progressive
  </strong>
  Scientific Journals available today,
  <br/>
  is bringing shame to many engineering Conferences and Journals,
  <br/>
  by taking the initiative and showing them how is that
  <strong>
   real scientific
   <br/>
   publishing is done
  </strong>
  when computation (software) is involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   PLoS ONE
  </strong>
  goes to the core of
  <strong>
   Openness
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Reproducibility
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Here are the instructions for authors,
  <br/>
  They are so perfect, that there is few we could add to them, except
  <br/>
  to express our admiration for a publisher that understand its role in
  <br/>
  the scientific community:  “Effective Dissemination of Usable Information”.
