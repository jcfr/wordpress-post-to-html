  The Air Force Research Labs located in Alberquerqie New Mexico has awarded Kitware Inc. a SBIR Phase I research grant to develop new algorithms for visualizing data with uncertainty. The data that computers process frequently contains uncertainty. An example of this is in weather forcasting, where a forcast will precict a 70% chance of rain. The 70% is called the uncertainty and in many applications it is ignored sometimes leading to disasterous results. The problem is that very few software systems have been developed to handle data with uncertainty, especially when it comes to visualization algorithms. Kitwareâ€™s expertise in visualization and object oriented design will be applied to develop new techniques to help people not only see the data, but also any uncertainty associated with it.
