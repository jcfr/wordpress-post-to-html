  To continue Kitware’s tradition of supporting the needs of our communities, our Clifton Park, NY, and Carrboro, NC, offices are conducting a drive for
  <a href="http://www.rmhc.org/">
   Ronald McDonald House Charities
  </a>
  (RMHC). The drive began last week and continues throughout this week. The drive consists of selling

   <strong>
    HEARTS
   </strong>
  </span>
  to support the program “Help With All Your Heart,” as well as baked goods for those who donate to the cause.
 </p>
 <p>
  To support the effort, Kitwareans have baked a variety of tasty treats. In addition, the hearts, signed with a name, message, or tribute, are being display in Kitware’s offices. The drive was organized by the Kitware Gives Back team. So far, Kitwareans have raised over $400 for RMHC.

  Stay tuned for next week’s blog entry, which will provide the final numbers of the fundraiser!
