   PET-CT Video
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <u>
   Description
  </u>
 </p>
 <p>
  This video demonstrates a 3D Slicer module (Guided Intervention PET/CT) that is implemented to improve the clinical effectiveness of liver lesion biopsy through the fusion of respiratory-compensated PET/CT with CT images in the interventional CT suite. This module is a workflow-based module that contains the following key steps: PET/CT data loading, registration, tracking connection, tool Calibration, patient registration, needle path planing and guidance. To demonstrate the workflow, we used a computer-controlled anthropomorphic phantom that has an embedded rib cage and a small opening in the thorax to allow percutaneous targeting. Within the thorax, we embedded FDG filled, sealable circular vials to serve as targets. These appear as areas of increased radiopharmaceutical activity on the PET image. The dose was injected into a small hollow plastic sphere with a threaded seal. The spheres were sealed, placed inside a simulated liver made of foam, and then placed in the anthropomorphic phantom. The phantom was first imaged with the PET/CT scanner and placed on the CT scanner in the interventional CT suite, where the biopsy procedure would typically be performed. Using the visual guidance of the fused PET/CT image and real-time location and position information from the tracking device, the biopsy needle was inserted into the phantom to target the sphere.
