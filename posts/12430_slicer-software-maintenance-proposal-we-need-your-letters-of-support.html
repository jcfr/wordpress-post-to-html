  Dear Kitware Medical Imaging Collaborators,
 </p>
 <p>
  Gabor Fichtinger and I are writing a grant proposal that is requesting NIH funding to support the continued development, maintenance, and distribution of
  <a href="http://slicer.org">
   3D Slicer
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki">
   PLUS toolkit
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The title of our proposal is
  <br/>
  <em>
   "Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis."
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  With the funding going to Kitware (me and JC), Queen's University (Gabor Fichtinger, Tamas Ungi, and Andras Lasso), Isomics (Steve Pieper), BWH, and many others, this proposal is meant to keep not only the software, but also the outstanding communities of Slicer and PLUS thriving for the next four years. The proposal uses the goal of adding real-time, ultrasound RF signal processing into Slicer as its "moon shot." In general, it seeks to improve our support of GPU-based methods, custom workflows, and third-party software integration. Our goal is to make certain that Slicer and PLUS continue to evolve as our community's research needs evolve.
 </p>
 <p>
