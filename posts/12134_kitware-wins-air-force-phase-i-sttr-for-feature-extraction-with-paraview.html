  Kitware has partnered with David Thompson at Mississippi State University and Raghu Machiraju at Ohio State University on a Phase I Air Force STTR. Since this is an STTR, David Thompson will be the academic partner leading this work. In the proposed work, ParaView will serve as the application framework upon which we will build feature extraction techniques for computational fluid dynamics. In particular, we will focus on complex, turbulent flow problems. These datasets are necessarily temporal in extent and exceptionally large in size. MSU and OSU have developed complex algorithms for feature extraction that we will incorporate into VTK and ParaView, with the goal of commercializing add-on modules.
