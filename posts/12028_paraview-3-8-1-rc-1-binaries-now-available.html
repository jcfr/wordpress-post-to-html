   Release Notes
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView 3.8.1 is a patch release over 3.8.0 with a a small set of improvements. The following are some noteworthy improvements and fixes.
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView now comes HDF5 1.8.5. This enables developers to create readers/plugins for ParaView that use newer versions of HDF5 easily. Also we are now including the C++ and the high level (hl) versions of the libraryfor those who wish to use their newer API.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the improvements are two new file formats. The first is a netcdf based reader for MPAS format ocean and atmosphere data sets. The second, available in source form only is a reader plugin that allows ParaView to read multi-resolution wavelet compressed VAPOR data format files. Thanks to John Clyne and Dan Legreca for contributing the VAPOR plugin.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have improved the support for animation scripting through Python. The new API is more coherant with the rest of ParaView Python API avoid the need for script writers to know the minute details of how to create animations using proxies. Tracing capabilies for animation were also revised.
 </p>
 <p>
  GPU volume ray cast mapper for voxel datasets now works in tile display mode as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  In keeping with our on going improvements of the ParaView’s charting capabilities, we have included a few more fixes regarding labels and axes placements.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also cleaned up ParaView build and install rules so that developers don’t have to worry about ‘rpath’ anymore. Also “make install” has been vastly improved on all platforms.
 </p>
 <p>
  This release also includes a material interface extraction filter thattakes a cell data volume fraction and generates a polydata surface. It also performs connectivity on the particles and generates a particle index as part of the cell data of the output. It computes the volume of each particle from the volume fraction. The filter is accessible from the Material Analysis category in the Filters menu.
