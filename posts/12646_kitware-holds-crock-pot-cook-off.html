   Kitwareans warmed up to slow cooking with our 2nd Annual Kitware Crock Pot Cook-off. Our employees put their cooking skills to the test and stirred up some competition. The “Crockpot Cook-off” challenged any person to bring in any tasty dish that could be cooked in that ubiquitous kitchen icon — the crock-pot. The only requirement was that it must have been cooked in a crock pot. At noon, all Kitwareans had a lunch of the creations and were the judges.
