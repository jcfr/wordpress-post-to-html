   This crowd had gone deadly silent, a Cinderella story outta nowhere. Former second-place finishers and now about to become the Bike to Work Challenge champions…yet again.

  We would like to thank the sponsors of the event, Bikeatoga and the CDTC. We look forward to pedaling our way to victory again next year!
