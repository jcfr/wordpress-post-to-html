  Kitware has been working with the Trilinos team (http://trilinos.sandia.gov) at Sandia National Labs to help them port to CMake/CTest/CDash. Trilinos is an extremely large software effort whose goal is to develop algorithms and enabling technologies for the solution of large-scale, complex, multi-physics engineering and scientific problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project is composed of more than 40 active subprojects each of which needs to be seen as a single large entity and as individual projects by themselves. Prior to CDash 1.4, global and individual project views of this scale and size weren’t possible. With the changes made to CDash and CTest, Trilinos developers are now able to receive dashboard emails for specific subprojects on which they are working. Additionally, CDash queries can now be saved and used as bookmarks.
