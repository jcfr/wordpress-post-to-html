  In a fascinating
  <strong>
   TED
  </strong>
  Talk,
  <strong>
   Jay Bradner
  </strong>
  walks us through some
  <br/>
  of the opportunities that an
  <em>
   “Open Source”
  </em>
  mindset can bring
  <br/>
  to the difficult challenges of medical research.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The first reaction of Bradner’s lab,
  <br/>
  when they made a discovery:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mail it to Colleagues !
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Publish an Open paper, and share the compounds with about
  <br/>
  40 labs around the world.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “..We seek to download from the amazing successes
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   of computing science industry two principles that are
  </em>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Open Source
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Crowd-Sourcing
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   to quickly, responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   therapeutics for patients with cancer.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  An
  <strong>
   inspiring story
  </strong>
  on the
  <strong>
   Open Source
  </strong>
  future of Medical Research,
  <br/>
  and the rediscovery of Ethical behavior in Scientific Research.
