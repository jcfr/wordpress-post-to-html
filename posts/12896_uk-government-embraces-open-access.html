    “Expanded Access to Research Publications and Data
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   6.6 The Government, in line with our overarching commitment to transparency and open
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   data, is committed to ensuring that
   <strong>
    publicly-funded research
   </strong>
   should be accessible
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    free of charge
   </strong>
   .
   <strong>
    Free and open access to taxpayer-funded research
   </strong>
   offers significant
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   social and economic benefits by spreading knowledge, raising the prestige of UK
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   research and encouraging technology transfer. At the moment, such research is
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   often difficult to find and expensive to access. This can defeat the original purpose of
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   taxpayer-funded academic research and limits understanding and innovation. We
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   have already committed, in our response to Ian Hargreaves’s review of intellectual
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   property, to facilitate data mining of published research. This could have substantial
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   benefits, for example in tackling diseases. But we need to go much further if, as a
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   nation, we are to gain the full potential benefits of publicly-funded research.”

   “6.7  There are many successful international examples of open access research. At
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Harvard, academics often grant the university a non-exclusive irrevocable right to
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   distribute their scholarly output for non-commercial use. Their articles are than
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   stored, preserved and made freely available through the Digital Access to
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Scholarship at Harvard (DASH). The UK has various similar examples of good
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   practice:
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   •  many universities and subject communities have their own digital open access
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   repositories;
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   •  the independent Wellcome Trust ensure all research they fund is made freely
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   available in UKPubMed, supported by the Medical Research Council, an online
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   resource; and
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   •  the British Medical Journal has been open access since 1998, with authors
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   making a payment to cover the costs of publication, including peer review.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “6.8  Government will work with partners, including the publishing industry, to achieve
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   free access to publicly-funded research as soon as possible and will set an example
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   itself.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   •  We have helped establish an independent working group chaired by Janet
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Finch to consider how to improve access to research publications, including
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   publicly-funded research. This will report in early 2012.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   •  The Royal Society is considering how to
   <strong>
    improve the sharing and disclosing
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    of research data,
   </strong>
   both within the research community and beyond. It will report
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   in early 2012.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   •  Alan Langlands is chairing a task force to advise on improving the
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   accessibility of data within Government and its agencies, which will advise
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   on
   <strong>
    data linkage, conditions of access and data quality.
   </strong>
   This will report during 2012.”

   “6.9  The Research Councils
   <strong>
    expect the researchers they fund to deposit published
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    articles or conference proceedings in an open access repository
   </strong>
   at or around the
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   time of publication. But this practice is unevenly enforced. Therefore, as an
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   immediate step, we have asked the Research Councils to
   <strong>
    ensure the researchers
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    they fund fulfil the current requirements
   </strong>
   . Additionally, the Research Councils have
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   now agreed to invest £2 million in the development, by 2013, of a UK ‘Gateway
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   to Research’. In the first instance this will allow ready access to Research Council
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   funded research information and related data but it will be designed so that it can
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   also include research funded by others in due course.
   <strong>
    The Research Councils will
   </strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   <em>
    work with their partners and users to ensure information is presented in a readily
   </em>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    reusable form, using common formats and open standards.
