  Before the recent announcement of
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/?s=chemistry+workbench">
   Open Chemistry
  </a>
  , I was invited to the
  <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/10/semantic-physical-science-workshop-2/">
   Semantic Physical Science Workshop
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://vimeo.com/35169794">
   Symposium
  </a>
  in Cambridge, England. The meeting was well attended, and Peter Murrary-Rust has put up
  <a href="http://vimeo.com/35169794">
   videos of the talks given
  </a>
  in the symposium on the final day. The meeting was ambitious, and we were able to get a lot done over a three day period. One of the things we are working to address in the
  <a href="http://openchemistry.org/">
   Open Chemistry
  </a>
  work is sharing and providing semantic meaning to data so that it can be searched. This workshop was a great opportunity to meet and discuss how that can be achieved with people from a diverse range backgrounds from code developers, researchers, publishers and end users.

  While in England I also had the opportunity to visit Abbie Trewin, a researcher working on molecular modeling of porous materials at the University of Liverpool. She was preparing for a visit from Andrew Miller, MP, as part of an MP pairing scheme to support links between politics and science. I had been looking at novel interaction techniques in

  for a while (since the symposium Peter Murray-Rust held last year, that I couldnâ€™t make it to), and this visit was just the motivation to finish off that work. I used the Microsoft Kinect, with the OpenNI drivers, and wrote a plugin for Avogadro to take skeletal data and manipulate the camera of the active view.

 <p>
  Abbie has

   detailed the entire day and provided videos on her site
  </a>
  . It looks like the day was a great success, and I really enjoyed making research in chemistry a little more fun and accessible for non-researchers. This is one of the great strengths of developing features in reusable libraries and applications that can be extended through plugins.
