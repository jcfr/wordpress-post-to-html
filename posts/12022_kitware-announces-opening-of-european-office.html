   Home to top-rated educational and research institutions, and offering a supportive business climate with a vibrant culture and lifestyle, Lyon was chosen due to its relatively central location in Europe, and its convenient access to European centers of business and technology. Several well-known biomedical companies and internationally renowned organizations, such as the World Health Organization and Interpol, are located in Lyon, and the city is at the forefront of medical technology having hosted the first robot-assisted surgical procedure in France in 2009.

   “[Kitware] recognizes the need to reach out to the international community and work with the most talented scientific computing professional and software engineers wherever they are located,” said Dr. Will Schroeder, president of Kitware’s U.S. office. Kitware’s open source systems have global impact, and the Lyon office provides a unique opportunity to expand into European markets and broaden the Company’s international reach.”
