  Kitware is pleased to announce the release of three 3D mobile viewing  applications for the Visible Patient project, led by the Research  Institute Against Digestive Cancer (IRCAD) in Strasbourg, France.  Inspired by the success of the Patient Specific Simulation and  Preoperative Realistic Training (PASSPORT) project, a surgical planning  simulator for dynamic liver modeling, the Visible Patient provides  surgeons with virtual 3D anatomies modeled on patient-specific data.

  IRCAD  teamed with Kitware to provide free, mobile and online visualization  solutions for viewing the 3D anatomy data. IRCAD based this development  effort on Kitware’s established open-source tools Midas, the Insight  Toolkit (ITK), and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). To accommodate a  wide array of mobile devices, Kitware created three Visible Patient  viewers. The web application, based on the WebGL standard that is  supported by the latest browsers, can be accessed directly from the

  website. The Visible Patient application for Android is built upon  Kitware’s powerful VES library and is dedicated to phones or tablets  running versions 2.3 or higher; it is available for download in the  Google Store. The iOS (for iOS5 and iOS6) solution for iPhone and iPad  users is based on the VES library, and is currently available in the  iTunes store.

  “We are thrilled to take part in the Visible Patient  project,” said Julien Jomier, President of Kitware SAS. “The open  access nature of these 3D visualization applications will not only  impact the quality of healthcare, but it also provides a great tool for  anyone looking to discover more about human anatomies.”

  The  Visible Patient and accompanying demo were first presented by Prof. Luc  Soler, Head of IRCAD R&amp;D, at IMAGINA 2012, a European conference on  3D simulation and virtual technology. The Visible Patient was then  presented by Prof. Marescaux, President of IRCAD, at the 15th  International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer  Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) during the first keynote lecture. Since  then, it was presented at several medical congresses and during all  IRCAD courses, each time generating considerable interest from the  scientific and medical communities

 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Today, IRCAD gives free access  to a database of 34 anonymous clinical cases including 3D modeling of  full bodies, and specific anatomical areas such as lungs, pancreas,  heart, liver, neck, and pelvis. New clinical cases will be regularly  added. IRCAD’s next step will be to give practitioners access to an  online service of 3D patient modeling using the Visible Patient viewer.
