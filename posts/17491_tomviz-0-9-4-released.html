  with some background). This release features improvements to volume and contour rendering. The support for retinal resolution on macOS has been been further improved, and antialiasing support for the main histogram has been enabled. The pipeline has seen a number of usability improvements, initial support for exporting analyzed data to a web page was added, and we have integrated a number of updated icons. We have made a number of improvements to the manual slice alignment dialog, and introduced measurement cubes along with visual elements for scale in the overlay.
