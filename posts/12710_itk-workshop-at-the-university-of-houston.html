   ITK Workshop
  </a>
  on May 15th and take part in a hackathon on May 16th.  The event was hosted by Dr. Badri Roysam, PI of the
  <a href="http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/">

  and

  </a>
  .

  The workshop was a great success.  Over 25 participants, who came from local research laboratories, local hospitals, and from academic institutions and companies as far away as Indiana and California, took part in the day-long event.  Working from VirtualBox virtual machines with ITK and tutorial material pre-installed, participants learned about the history of ITK and its capabilities, analysis with
