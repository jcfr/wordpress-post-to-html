  <strong>
   Redesigned Color Map Editor panel
  </strong>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   This release introduces a completely designed panel for editing color and opacity transfer functions for scalar coloring. The panel, which is now a dockable widget, instead of a popup dialog, makes it easier to edit transfer functions as well as edit labels and annotations on the color legend or scalar bar. This also makes it easier to access some of the functionality introduced in the previous version of ParaView, such as categorical colors. It is now easier to edit transfer functions when using log scaling as the transfer function editor view now switches to log space.

   Enhancements to Find Data dialog
  </strong>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   Find Data dialog, introduced several versions ago, has quickly become of the main mechanisms for creating new selections. However, until now, if the user created selection using some other mechanism, such as selecting cells in the 3D view, the Find Data dialog could not be used to inspect that selection. One had to use what was called the Selection Inspector. That has now been changed. Find Data dialog has been updated to always show the active selection, no matter how it was created.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   Selection Inspector panel has been removed. Selection Inspector was primarily used to control how selections are labelled, their font properties, etc. One can affect these directly from the Find Data dialog or the new
  </span>
  <strong>
   Selection Display Inspector
  </strong>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   which is dockable panel specially designed for picking selection labels, label properties, or showing the selection frustum for frustum based selections.

   Enhancements for interactions with Plots
  </strong>

  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   Inspired by plots in
  </span>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   , individual axes in line and bar charts can  now be
  </span>
  <em>
   zoomed
  </em>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   by right-clicking and dragging along the x- or y- axis. Of course, one can still drag diagonally to scale both axes as before. Also the the user interactions for making new selections in line chart view have been cleaned up to be more consistent with the render view.

   Support for Python-based views
  </strong>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   This release adds mechanisms to enable Python developers to integrate views that use libraries such as
  </span>
  <strong>
   matplotlib
  </strong>
  <span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 15px;">
   for rendering. This will make it possible to take ParaView’s charting capabilities even further. More details on how to create such views can be found on

   A set of experimental interfaces have been added for reusing simulation memory in portions of a Catalyst pipeline. A vtkMappedDataArray subclass may be used for attribute/coordinate arrays, and vtkMappedUnstructuredGrid is used for dataset topologies. More information can be found an the
