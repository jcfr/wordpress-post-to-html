  Recently, we (Kitware &amp; NYU Poly) presented ClimatePipes at the AGU Fall Meeting 2013 and received very positive feedback from the community.
  <span>
   The overarching goals of ClimatePipes are:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   – Enable users to explore real-world questions related to climate change.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   – Provide open source tools for data access, analysis, and visualization.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   – Facilitate collaboration by enabling users to share datasets, workflows, and visualization.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>

   ClimatePipes uses a web-based application platform for its widespread support on mainstream operating systems, ease-of-use, and inherent collaboration support. The front-end of ClimatePipes uses HTML5 (WebGL, Canvas2D, CSS3) to deliver state-of-the-art visualization and to provide a best-in-class user experience. The back-end of the ClimatePipes is built around Python using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK, http://vtk.org), Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT, http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov), and other climate and geospatial data processing tools such as GDAL and PROJ4. As part of the ClimatePipes project we have developed VGL (WebGL based renderer), GeoJS (Geo-visualization library), and PyGeo (Data processing and compute backend in python for geosciences).
