     New Offerings for Open Source Courses
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Kitware is pleased to announce two new options for training courses. We will be hosting our first course in Europe February 2-4, 2011 in Lyon, France. This course will cover the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK), the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), CMake and ParaView, and is suitable for developers who would like to learn more about these tools and for project managers looking to integrate these software tools into their team’s development environment.  The course will be a hands-on experience and attendees can work in the development environment of their choice (Windows, Linux or Mac), allowing them to better focus on the content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, Kitware is debuting new online courses. There will be various topics covered on the different toolkits, including ITK, VTK, CMake and ParaView. A variety of instructor-led 90-minute online courses will be offered, covering both introductory and more advanced topics in each open source project.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a complete course catalog with detailed descriptions, course calendar and registration information, please visit the training page on our website, www.kitware.com. If you would like to arrange a custom course tailored to your precise needs, please email courses@kitware.com or call us at (518) 371-3971.

     Kitware Honors Dedicated Employees
    </strong>
   </span>
   <br/>
  </span>
  In December, Kitware presented Brad King and Berk Geveci with awards commemorating their 10 years at Kitware, a career milestone that speaks to their strong commitment to both Kitware and the greater open source development community.

  Brad King joined Kitware in June 2000 as a summer intern while pursuing his B.S. at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.  Brad continued working at Kitware while completing his undergraduate and graduate education, receiving his Ph.D. in December 2008. Dr. King is an invaluable member of the Kitware software development team, and is a lead contributor to CMake, Kitware’s most popular open-source project. Brad is also a major contributor to VTK’s advanced pipeline architecture and the ITK wrapping process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Berk Geveci joined Kitware in September 2000 after completing his Ph.D. at Lehigh University, and a post-doctoral position at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Geveci has been instrumental in growing Kitware’s scientific visualization business, and now serves as the Director of Scientific Computing for Kitware.  Berk is one of the lead developers of both ParaView and VTK, and has extensive expertise in the areas of large scale parallel computing, computational dynamics, finite elements and visualization algorithms. His award-winning efforts have resulted in Kitware’s tools being used in numerous government and commercial research labs, and on most of the world’s top high-performance computing platforms.

     Open Sourcing Microscopy: CSHL Meeting
    </span>
   </strong>
   <br/>
  </span>
  In December, Luis Ibáñez and Dhanannjay Deo attended the Cold Spring Harbor Lab meeting on High Throughput Image Analysis in Phenotyping. Phenotyping is the study of observable characteristics of an organism resulting from the expression of its genes and their interaction with the environment. The meeting attendees discussed their work in image analysis in phenotyping, some of the challenges and obstacles they face in doing their research and possible methods for improvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the biggest challenges facing biologists in this field is the massive amount of data produced; it is now common to run experiments whose output amounts to several terabytes of data. Each researcher has several experiments in progress simultaneously and the need for storage and advanced image processing capabilities for this data is of the utmost importance.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Biologists have generally recognized the value of open source in research and helped usher in the open access movement. As such, the discussion on moving the field of microscopy image analysis forward included several references to open source solutions. The key topics included archiving for image storage, standard data formats and interoperability for data sharing, knowledge representation, interfaces and making open source resources interoperable, and funding issues. With open source as a feature of several of these topics, appropriate funding is necessary to develop high-quality maintainable software and an issue that needs to be addressed by funding agencies such as the NSF and NIH.
 </p>
 <p>
  The talk was attended by representatives from top international labs and the developers of OME, ImageJ, Bio-formats and CellProfiler. The meeting was fruitful and some very interesting projects, such as spectral plant imaging and the use of micro-fluidics in C.Elegans worm phenotyping, were covered. There has been a  follow-up meeting scheduled for April 2012.
