  MICCAI offers a window into the latest scientific achievements in medical image computing and computer assisted interventions which will lead to the next generation of technological breakthroughs for improved clinical care. A critical step to maximize the long-term positive impact of MICCAI cutting-edge algorithms is to enable their deployment, validation and concrete use by the clinical research community for whom they were developed.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the past six years, the
  <a href="http://www.na-mic.org/">
   National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC)
  </a>
  , one of the seven National Centers for Biomedical Computing (NCBC), part of the NIH Roadmap for medical research, has focused its efforts on the conversion of scientific advances from the biomedical imaging community into open-source resources for users and developers, in order to improve the availability and deployment of advanced software tools on a national and international scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  The objective of the tutorial is to introduce the challenges inherent in delivering advanced medical imaging technologies to end-users for clinical translational research. The tutorial provides open source, freely available solutions to these challenges and presents multiple examples of clinical research projects that have been recently completed or that are underway.
