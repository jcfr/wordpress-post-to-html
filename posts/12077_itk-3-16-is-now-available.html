   ITK
  </a>
  is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis. ITK is distributed under an OSI-Approved BSD License and has been developed using the same software engineering tools as VTK (e.g., cmake, dashboards, doxygen). ITK provides leading-edge algorithms for registering and segmenting multidimensional data. Additionally, methods exist in the InsightApplications repository for connecting ITK and VTK pipelines together.
