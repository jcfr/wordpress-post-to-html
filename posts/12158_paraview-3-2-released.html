  This release includes the following enhancements/fixes:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   New animation view for viewing, creating and modifying animations, making ParaView more intuitive and easier to use.
  </li>
  <li>
   The “Element Inspector” has been replaced by a brand new “Spreadsheet View” which makes it possible to view raw data produced by any source/filter.
  </li>
  <li>
   Filters with multiple outputs and inputs are now supported; this has opened doors for several new filters such as glyph with custom source, stream tracer with custom point source, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
   There are several improvements to charts including support for vector data in line charts (magnitude or component); support for labels; titles and legends; and custom chart axes end points.
  </li>
  <li>
   Selection support has undergone a major overhaul. It is now possible to select cells (or points) on geometry surfaces or within a view frustum by simply dragging on the 3D view. The properties of the selection can be inspected/changed using the brand new “Selection Inspector” accessible through the “View” menu. The “Extract Selection” filter can be used to extract the selected cells or points. Labels can be used to label the selected cells or points.
  </li>
  <li>
   Support for eXtensible Data model and Format (XDMF) files is back and improved to support composite datasets, quadratic elements and mixed topologies. It is now possible to change domain and grid selections as well.
  </li>
  <li>
   We are working on making ParaView function with ease when working with composite data sets. As a part of the process histogram (and soon probe) filters now work with composite datasets. The python client can fetch composite datasets as well as perform operations such as min/max/sum on these dataset.
  </li>
  <li>
   A new python module is introduced which makes dealing with proxies convenient. A separate document is available describing these python enhancements.
  </li>
  <li>
   This version has many GUI usability improvements including but definitely not limited to:
   <ul>
    <li>
     View based and application settings
    </li>
    <li>
     Using mouse clicks for picking the center of rotation and point widget location
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   We are constantly trying to make the documentation better. The online help has been extended to include the new functionalities added since 3.0.
  </li>
 </ul>
