  Kitware released version 4.11 of the
  <a href="https://itk.org/">
   National Library of Medicine Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
  </a>
  (ITK) to support scientific discovery through medical image analysis. Version 4.11 added remote modules to increase support for the capabilities of the toolkit. This release also bolsters code coverage, and provides members of the medical community with an open-source, cross-platform solution for analyzing images such as those acquired from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound procedures.

  Remote modules served as a noteworthy area of focus for ITK 4.11 development. With new modules, ITK perturbs mesh vertices with additive Gaussian noise; accurately benchmarks computational performance; performs principal components analysis of scalar, vector, and mesh vertex data; interpolates multi-label images; and iterates over multiple images simultaneously. Several other improvements made to ITK pertain to filtering. With the addition of

  , for example, enhancing edges is as simple as ever.

   ITK also improved input/output with Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) support, and it enhanced wrapping. ITK now wraps more classes and uses a new CMake function to test Python scripts in modules. Furthermore, ITK learned to only load individual Python modules when required, which decreases load time. In addition, ITK
