  First was project week, starting on Monday (photo above). There I helped Peter Behringer from BWH adjust BSpline registration parameters for prostate MRIs after transitioning from Slicer3 to Slicer4. I also gave some advice in

   I had a some discussions with Laura Sanz and Javier Pascau from Madrid regarding surface scanners, which we need in one of our ongoing projects (skull correction). I had my
