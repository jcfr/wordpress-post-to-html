  The
  <strong>
   International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)
  </strong>
  is hosting eight contests to challenge medical imaging researchers to showcase their best methods and participate in direct head-to-head comparisons.  These contests represent eight significant, real-world problems facing biomedical imaginge researchers and product developers.  These contests are open to public participation, as "grand challenges."
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   These grand challenges
  </span>
  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">
   are:

 <p>
  1. White Matter Modeling
  <br/>
  2. Cell Tracking Challenge
  <br/>
  3. Segmentation of Overlapping Cervical Cells from Multi-layer Cytology Preparation Volumes
  <br/>
  4. Grand Challenges in Dental X-ray Image Analysis
  <br/>
  5. Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation
  <br/>
  6. MR Brain Image Segmentation in Neonates versus Adults (NEATBrainS15)
  <br/>
  7. Automatic Polyp Detection Challenge in Colonoscopy Videos
  <br/>
  8. VISCERAL Anatomy for Grand Challenge
 </p>

  Grand challenges are outstanding examples of how open sceience can accelerate the pace of research.  By freely providing standardize datasets that capture the complexity of a real-world problem, using high-quality experimental design and metrics to evaluate results, opening participation to the world, and providing a forum for the presentation of results; grand challenges provide deep insight into the state-of-the-art and promising research directions for meaningful problems.

   We are proud to be helping to organize these grand challenges at ISBI in 2015.  We will also be particpating in the
   <a href="http://spie.org/MI/conferencedetails/computer-aided-diagnosis#session-10">
    grand challenge discussion panel
   </a>
   at SPIE Medical Imaging in February 2015.  These continue our long tradition for supporting grand challenges and open science.  We welcome other opportunities to support grand challenges and open science into the future.
