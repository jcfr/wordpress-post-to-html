  SC15 is off to a great start, and we are pleased to have
  <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">
   ParaView
  </a>
  prominently featured at the conference. In addition to being represented in many of our conference activities, which we
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-announces-exascale-exhibition-at-sc15-2/">
   announced
  </a>
  last week, ParaView is being highlighted by several of our collaborators. This weekend, for example, ParView was showcased in two sessions by Paul Navratil at the
  <a href="https://hpcdevcon.intel.com/agenda.html">
   Intel HPC Developer Conference
  </a>
  , titled “TACC and Intel SDVis Workshop: ParaView with SDVis.”

  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Intel Booth, ParaView with Intel’s OSPRay and Intel’s OpenSWR rendering libraries integrated, running on a cluster with Knights Landing and Intel(r) Xeon(r) processors connected with Intel(r) OmniPath fabric, shows the ability for climate scientists to interactively view and explore “vortex eddies” near land masses and ocean floor features that can help scientists understand climate change.  The visualization was created using data from the recently-developed Model for Prediction Across Scales-Ocean (MPAS-Ocean), which is designed to investigate climate change at global high-resolution (5 to 10 km grid cells) on high-performance computing platforms. Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) ran the simulations and collaborated with Texas Advanced Computing Center’s (TACC’s) and Intel’s visualization teams to show the almost 500GB data set running interactively with incredible visual fidelity.

   At the Scientific Visualization Showcase
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ParaView was used in multiple of this year’s
  <a href="http://http://sc15.supercomputing.org/program/scientific-visualization-showcase">
   showcase
  </a>
  movie submissions. In fact, two of the submissions were done entirely in ParaView:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <div>
    Gasoline Compression Ignition: Optimizing Start of Injection Time
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   <div>
    Visualization of Ocean Currents and Eddies in a High-Resolution Ocean Model
   </div>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  ParaView was also used in part for the following submission:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Visualization Of Airflow Through The Human Respiratory System: The Sniff
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Check out the movies for yourself at the showcase on Wednesday, November 18th, at 10:30 am.
