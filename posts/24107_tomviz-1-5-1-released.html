  , along with a few longer standing issues we tracked down. An issue affecting manual image alignment that could cause crashes when certain offset values were used near the start or end of a tilt series was fixed, and a crash affecting the loading of state files where the data file was not in the expected location was also addressed. Several other minor issues were addressed, such as reducing memory use in one of the reconstruction operators.

  This is probably our final release in 2018, and we would like to thank the entire community for their feedback and support. Work on the 1.6 release has already begun with better support for data that contains more than one channel, along with improving our support for “live” pipelines where data is being acquired. As always we welcome your feedback, and hope that you find this release useful in your research!
