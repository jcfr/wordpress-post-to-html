  Kitware is pleased to announce a contract award on the Data to  Decisions program from the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The goal of  Data to Decisions is to develop, evaluate and test prototype decision  support systems for persistent ISR data.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Kitware program addresses the problem of dealing with data overload in military intelligence.
  <br/>
  For this project, Kitware will develop automated algorithms to  provide rapid filtering of Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) volumes.  Having automated algorithms running in near real-time will enable  detection of impending threats such as roadside bombs before they are  encountered by warfighters.

  “We are thrilled to be working with ONR on developing solutions for  WAMI data exploitation,” said Dr. Anthony Hoogs, Senior Director of  Computer Vision at Kitware. “Our team is well-versed in developing  algorithms for making sense of large, complex WAMI data. By leveraging  our experience on related efforts in video analysis for intelligence, we  will be able to contribute to this effort of National importance, which  will help save warfighter lives.”

  The project is a collaborative team effort of seven industry and  university performers, including: SOARTech, Signal Innovation Group,  Systems Technology Research, Lockheed Martin, and University of Southern  California.  Several government sponsored research organizations are  also involved in key roles, including: Air Force Research Laboratory,  Army Research Laboratory, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Naval Air Warfare  Center Weapons Division China Lake, and the Office of Naval Research.
