     In our AaaS projects, we work with our customers to understand their algorithms, data sources, analytic goals, cloud requirements, target customers, and data workflows. Then we combine that understanding with our domain and software design expertise. Throughout the process, we coordinate the overall efforts and add to the quality and value of each step. We help our customers identify and fill in gaps in their methods, plans, and cloud-based practices so that all runs smoothly. We know the long-term benefits of establishing easy-to-maintain, high-quality software practices.

    With the UNC Department of Radiology, we are building a web-hosted service for research into the better prediction of stroke outcomes.  Researchers will be able to upload their contrast-enhanced X-ray CT images to our system, and within a few minutes, our system will return multiple measures used in stroke outcome prediction.  The mix of standard and innovative measures provided by our system can reduce the study size and cost required for statistically significant stroke treatment research.

    With the University of Southern California, we are deploying algorithms on the web to help with the analysis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI).  This system enables researchers to compare the MRI scans of patients with TBIs to standard anatomic atlases.  These comparisons can enable researchers to measure and generate new insights into the complex and often dramatic changes that can occur in TBI cases.
