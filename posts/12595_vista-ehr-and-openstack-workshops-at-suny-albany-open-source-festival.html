   OpenStack

  continues to grow exponentially as the de facto standard for open source Cloud platforms.  But how can someone quickly get started with learning this exciting new technology?  This workshop will walk participants through an overview of the OpenStack components and offer practical suggestions and resources for learning OpenStack.  Then to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenStack, we will guide participants through the OpenStack portal and give everyone an opportunity to launch cloud computing resources from their own laptop.

   Workshop Overview:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Healthcare consumes 18% of GDP in the US, while the nation ranks 28th in measures of healthcare quality. Less than 50% of hospitals in the US currently use computer systems to manage patient information: electronic health records (EHR). In the meantime, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have developed and used for more than four decades: VistA the most advanced EHR system worldwide. VistA is considered one of the main reasons why the VA provides the highest quality of healthcare in the US, at much lower cost than any of the public and private sector providers.  In this workshop, VistA experts from DSS Inc will introduce attendees to some of the basic concepts in VistA, and to the development of extensions for its interface CPRS. No background on VistA is required to participate. Attendees will be introduced to all basic concepts during the workshop.
 </p>
