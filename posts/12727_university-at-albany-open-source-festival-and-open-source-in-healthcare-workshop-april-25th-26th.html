      The Raspberry Pi, a $35 open source computer hardware, that is powerful enough to drive an entertainment center, host a web server, drive robotic devices, and provide enough computing power for video processing, etc. The Pi has revived the natural curiousity of humans to enables them to explore how things work, and modify them to further their understanding. This talk will advance a case for creating a working area, known as a

      The Albany Medical College has used open source software to develop educational materials suitable for teaching brain anatomy to medical students. In this presentation, we demonstrate how the software has been ported to a web-based platform and it is starting to be modified according to the principles of gamification in order to make it more attractive and engaging to the the students, and therefore become a more effective teaching platform.
