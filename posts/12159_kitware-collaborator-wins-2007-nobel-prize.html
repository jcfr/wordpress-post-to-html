   Kitware worked with Dr. Smithies and successfully received an NIH Phase I STTR grant to construct detailed anatomical models of gene expression when mice hearts undergo stress. The models were made by stitching and stacking 3D confocal micropscopy images taken from thinly-sliced tissue sections of mice hearts. Dr. Smithies’ team manipulated the genes of the mice so that their heart cells would fluoresce when certain genes within them were activated. The confocal microscopy images captured the florescence from excised tissue samples. Kitware’s reconstruction method allowed his team to visualize global and local patterns of gene expression when heart damage is induced.

   Kitware’s team included Stephen Aylward (PI), Lisa Avila (co-PI), Julien Jomier and Will Schroeder. UNC’s team included Oliver Smithies and Kumar Pandya. Research interns from the University of Lyon, France, also participated: Cedric Caron and Remi Charrier.
