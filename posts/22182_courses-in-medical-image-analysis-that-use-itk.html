    from John Galeotti at Carnegie-Mellon has both lecture Powerpoints and high quality video recordings of the lectures available. Its purpose, from its syllabus, is “to gain theoretical and practical skills in medical image analysis, including skills relevant to general image analysis.  The fundamentals of computational medical image analysis will be explored, leading to current research in applying geometry and statistics to segmentation, registration, visualization, and image understanding. Student will develop practical experience through projects using the new v4 of the National Library of Medicine Insight Toolkit (ITK), a popular open-source software library developed by a consortium of institutions including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.”
