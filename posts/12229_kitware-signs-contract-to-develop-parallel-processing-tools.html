  Kitware was signed a three-year contract with the three National Labs – Los Alamos, Sandia, and Livermore – to develop parallel processing tools for VTK.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of the project is to develop scalable parallel processing tools with an emphasis on distributed memory implementations. The project includes parallel algorithms, infrastructure, I/O, support, and display devices. In addition, some GUI components and end-user applications will be developed. The bulk of the technology developed in this contract will be embedded into the standard VTK open-source distribution.
