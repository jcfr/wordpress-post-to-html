  Before I start, let me mention that several of the components that you see in this article/video are not available in an official ParaView release as I write this. The adventurous few can try the nightly binaries, others should wait for the next release of ParaView (with eager anticipation, I hope!).

  What's the fuss about?
 </h3>
 <p>
  In past several people have asked, "how do I color contours and then show a color-legend that shows the colored contour values?". While working on the updating the UI for the color editor, I stumbled upon doing that myself only to realize that it's now quite easy to do!

  Check the video out:

  Notice how:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   I can add several iso-values by typing text and then hitting the
   <strong>
    Tab
   </strong>
   to add a new entry and edit it without any additional clicks.
  </li>
  <li>
   I switch the color map to be a collection of discrete categories which then allows me to add colors for each category.
  </li>
  <li>
   I
   <em>
    import
   </em>
   the discrete values from the dataset by simply clicking the
   <strong>
    Add active values
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Then, I choose a preset to assign colors to each of the discrete vales
  </li>
  <li>
   Last but not the least, I show the scalar bar and voila!
  </li>
 </ul>
