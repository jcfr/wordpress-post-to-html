  This Phase I SBIR awarded by the National Center for Research Resources will develop tools for dual energy segmentation and removal of bone from the vicinity of the carotid arteries. This technology will enable contrast enhanced angiography studies where the bone and vasculature anatomy can be confounded for a single energy CT scan. Kitware is teamed with Sandy Napel of Stanford University on this effort.
