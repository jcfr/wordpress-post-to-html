  Clifton Park, NY October 29 – Kitware is pleased to announce the launch of OSA’s Interactive Science Publishing (ISP) system.  ISP is the first open-access scientific publication system that allows authors to distribute imaging datasets and advanced visualizations over the Internet for interactive display.  The dissemination of information and data using novel software technology and systems falls directly in line with Kitware’s organizational goals and its efforts to advance publishing systems for open science.  OSA ISP is a unique publishing system that enables researchers to create active publications supporting direct interaction with the data referred to in the publication.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Kitware is delighted to have partnered with the Optical Society of America and the National Library of Medicine to develop and launch the Interactive Science Publishing system,” said Kitware’s Director of Medical Applications, Rick Avila. “This first of its kind open-access system represents an important milestone in scientific publishing that will significantly improve the dissemination of scientific findings and ultimately accelerate scientific enquiry, all of which are at the core of Kitware’s long-standing commitment to open science.”
 </p>
 <p>
  ISP was built on top of Kitware’s MIDAS multimedia server and VolView visualization application, which is an intuitive, interactive system for volume visualization.   ISP allows authors to submit a manuscript including large three-dimensional data sets and the visualization settings needed to reproduce figures in the manuscript.  Readers are then able to load and interactively explore the author’s datasets using advanced 2D and 3D display methods and tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ISP software is the result of an ISP initiative between The Optical Society (OSA) and the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  Kitware collaborated with OSA, a leader in providing educational resources that support technical and professional development in the field of optics, to develop the ISP software.
 </p>
 <p>
  ISP provides the opportunity for researchers, scientists and engineers to evaluate new research results more thoroughly.  OSA staff published the first two ISP articles in their all-electronic journal for optics, Optics Express on October 15.
