  <a href="http://www.topworkplaces.com/frontend.php/regional-lists">
   Top Workplaces
  </a>
  honor by the Albany Times Union. The Top Workplaces lists are based solely on the results of an employee feedback survey administered by
  <a href="http://www.workplacedynamics.com/">
   WorkplaceDynamics, LLC
  </a>
  , a leading research firm that specializes in organizational health and workplace improvement. Several aspects of workplace culture were measured, including Alignment, Execution, and Connection, just to name a few.

  “The Top Workplaces award is not a popularity contest. And oftentimes, people assume it’s all about fancy perks and benefits,” Doug Claffey, CEO of WorkplaceDynamics, said. “But to be a Top Workplace, organizations must meet our strict standards for organizational health. And who better to ask about work life than the people who live the culture every day—the employees. Time and time again, our research has proven that what’s most important to them is a strong belief in where the organization is headed, how it’s going to get there, and the feeling that everyone is in it together.” Claffey adds, “Without this sense of connection, an organization doesn’t have a shot at being named a Top Workplace.”
