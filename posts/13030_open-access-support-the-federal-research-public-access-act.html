  If you are a supporter of
  <strong>
   Open Access
  </strong>
  , here is a unique opportunity to make a big step toward making the results of scientific research accessible to all:
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.1373:">
   Federal Research Public Access Act
  </a>
  (
  <strong>
   FRPAA
  </strong>
  )
  <br/>
  <strong>
   <br/>
   What this legislation will do:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="atatext">
  Every federal agency with an
  <strong>
   annual extramural research budget of $100 million
  </strong>
  or more will implement a
  <strong>
   public access policy
  </strong>
  that is consistent with and advances the federal purpose of the respective agency.  Each agency must:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="atatext">
   Require each researcher – funded totally or partially by the agency – to submit an electronic copy of the final manuscript that has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
  </li>
  <li class="atatext">
   Ensure that the manuscript is preserved in a stable digital repository maintained by that agency or in another suitable repository that permits free public access, interoperability, and long-term preservation. Agencies have the flexibility to choose the best suitable location for their repository.
  </li>
  <li class="atatext">
   Require that free, online access to each taxpayer-funded manuscript be available as soon as possible, and no later than six months after the article has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="atatext">
  <strong>
   To whom this policy applies:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="atatext">
   Any researcher
   <em>
    employed
   </em>
   by a federal agency with an annual research budget exceeding $100 million who publishes an article based on the work done for the funding agency in a peer-reviewed journal.
  </li>
  <li class="atatext">
   Any researcher
   <em>
    funded
   </em>
   by a federal agency with an annual research budget exceeding $100 million who publishes an article based on the funded research in a peer-reviewed journal.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Today, only the
  <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">
   National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a public access policy
  </a>
  . This new legislation will extend this level of openness to other federal agencies, including:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Department of Agriculture
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Commerce
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Defense
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Education,
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Energy
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Health and Human Services
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Homeland Security
  </li>
  <li>
   Department of Transportation
  </li>
  <li>
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
  </li>
  <li>
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
  </li>
  <li>
   National Science Foundation (NSF).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In summary, all agencies with an annual
  <strong>
   extramural budget
  </strong>
  above
  <strong>
   $100 million
  </strong>
  .

   How would you deal with Copyright when submitting your papers to a Journal ?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  When the author of an article is a federal grantee or is working for a federal grantee, he or she normally grants to the funding agency a non-exclusive and irrevocable license to “reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so” (2CFR215.36(a)). Posting the article in an online repository falls within these delineated rights. Any assignment of copyright by an author subsequent to accepting a federal grant is subject to the agency’s pre-existing, non-exclusive license:
