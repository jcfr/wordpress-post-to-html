 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   “… a measure that requires state agencies

  Some highlights of the text (emphasis from us):
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   “This bill
   <strong>
    requires
   </strong>
   state agencies
   <br/>
   to
   <strong>
    consider open source
   </strong>
   software
   <br/>
   <strong>
    when acquiring software
   </strong>
   and
   <br/>
   <strong>
    promote
   </strong>
   the use of
   <strong>
    open data formats
   </strong>
   <br/>
   by
   <strong>
    state agencies
   </strong>
   .”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the economic rationale for it:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em style="font-size: small;">
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook';">
     The cost of obtaining software for the state’s computer systems has become a significant expense to the state;
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em style="font-size: small;">
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook';">
     The personnel costs of maintaining the software on the state’s computers has also become a significant expense to the state;
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Some of the findings about what Open Source will bring to New Hampshire:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     The acquisition and widespread deployment of open source software can significantly reduce the state’s costs of obtaining and maintaining software;
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     Open source software guarantees that its encoding of data is not tied to a single provider;
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     Open source software enables interoperability through adherence to open, platform-neutral standards;
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     Open source software contains no restrictions on how, or for how long, it may be used; and
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     Since open source software fully discloses its internal operations, it can be audited, at any time and by anyone of the state’s choosing, for internal functions that are contrary to the public’s interests and rights.
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>
  Cleverly enough, they do have a clear definition of
  <strong>
   “Proprietary Software
  </strong>
  :
  <strong>
   “
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>
   III. “Proprietary software” means software
   <br/>
   that does not fulfill all of the guarantees
   <br/>
   provided by open source software.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The guarantees of Open Source have been nicely listed in Section II of the document.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the guidelines for acquisitions, the legislature gives the boot to software that abuses the rights of adopters; more specifically, it instructs to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     Avoid the acquisition of products that do not comply with open standards for interoperability or data storage; and
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: small;">
     Avoid the acquisition of products that are known to make unauthorized transfers of information to, or permit unauthorized control of or modification of a state agency’s computer.
    </span>
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It also orders state agencies to maintain an inventory of Open Source and Proprietary software.

  With this move, the New Hampshire’s legislature is not only making a smart and sound economic and political decision, it is also honoring to the core their State Motto:
