   Saratoga Bike to Work and School Challenge
  </a>
  . I am happy to report that Kitware improved upon our second place showing from 2009, this time finishing first in our category and taking home the coveted GearHead trophy. It was a perfect day to leave the car at home, with warm weather, sunny skies, and no appreciable wind. Thanks in part to the weather, and in part to the great job the organizers did putting on a bike to work corporate challenge, there were over 300 fewer people driving in Saratoga county on Friday!
