  Kitware was honored with a Tibbetts Award for its  Software Toolkit for Image-Guided Surgery (IGSTK) Phase I and II STTRS.  The award, which recognizes companies who represent excellence in  achieving the mission and goals of SBIR and STTR programs,  is named for  Roland Tibbetts. Tibbetts is considered the father of the Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which he began as an  experimental project at the National Science Foundation in the early  1980’s.

  IGSTK, Kitware’s cutting-edge tool for research  involving minimally invasive image-guided medical procedures, is being  used in investigations into new surgical techniques that may improve  surgical accuracy and precision, increase a surgeon’s ability to  confidently treat challenging and complex pathologies, decrease surgical  trauma, and reduce recovery time for patients.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Funded by the National Institute of Biomedical  Imaging and Bioengineering, IGSTK is also groundbreaking in that it is  freely available as open-source software. As open-source software, there  are no licensing fees for using IGSTK, which enables cost-effective  development and implementation.

  “The SBIR and STTR programs are a key component of  our success,” said Dr. Enquobahrie, a Technical Leader on the project.  “They enable us to develop innovative open-source tools, build  communities who use and support those tools, and thereby expand our  collaborative research and commercial consulting base. For instance, the  IGSTK STTR was a collaborative research project between Kitware’s New  York and North Carolina offices and the Computer Aided Interventional  and Medical Robotics (CAIMR) group, led by Dr. Kevin Cleary at  Georgetown University.
