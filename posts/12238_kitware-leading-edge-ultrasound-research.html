   Ultrasound
  </strong>
  has become a catalyst for innovation, new insights, and improved methods in a wide range of clinical procedures and medical research applications. A longstanding centerpiece in the practice of obstetrics, cardiology, and radiology, ultrasound research and development activity has surged in the past few years. This surge is evident in the double-digit growth rate of the portable ultrasound device market in non-traditional specialties, e.g., anesthesiology, musculoskeletal, and emergency medicine

   Kitware
  </strong>
  is on the leading-edge of ultrasound research and development. Working with academic and industrial pioneers, we are laying the groundwork for next-generation devices that will generate cost-savings for the healthcare system and, most importantly, save lives. In particular, we are focusing on approaches that enable
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-and-interson-partner-to-facilitate-portable-ultrasound/">
   low-cost yet highly capable ultrasound equipment
  </a>
  to be used in a broad range of clinical contexts by relatively less experienced medical personnel. We envision ultrasound becoming the stethoscope of the future—pervasive in doctors offices, ambulances, and clinics around the world; however, this future will only be achieved if the necessary expertise can be embedded within the algorithms and user interfaces of those highly portable ultrasound probes.

    TRENDS
   </span>
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Four trends
  </strong>
  that are forming within the field of medical ultrasound research are as follows:
 </p>
 <h4>
  Trend #1:  Measurement Automation
 </h4>
 <p>
  Fully realized, this trend will make it possible for users with almost no experience to deploy ultrasound imaging in multiple settings. The benefits will include 1) reduced costs to the healthcare system by targeting novice users as well as in-field, in-home, pre-hospital and bedside (i.e., “point-of-care”) applications; 2) better patient outcomes, as imaging can be obtained earlier in (e.g., at the scene of an accident, for patient triage) and more frequently during the disease course; and 3) improved measurement standardization and inter-user reliability.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Trend #2:  Multi-modality and Longitudinal Image Fusion, in the Presence of Pathologies
 </h4>
 <p>
  The roles of fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are well established for diagnosis and surgical planning; however, these baseline images can only be acquired prior to or intermittently during surgeries and treatments. This leaves the clinician to work with planning images that become increasingly irrelevant as the disease progresses or as the surgeons move or remove anatomical structures. Ultrasound, which can track real-time anatomical changes, can serve as a bridge between baseline images and the current conditions of the patients.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Trend #3:  Computer-Assisted Ultrasound Probe Placement
 </h4>
 <p>
  Determining where to place an ultrasound probe and how to move that probe to view a particular anatomic structure requires significant training and expertise. Such trained experts are frequently not available for point-of-care applications.  Novel three-dimensional (3D) tracking technologies and image analysis methods are being integrated to provide real-time estimates of the anatomic location of an ultrasound probe, and robotic systems are being devised to automate probe placement for clinical and research applications, to bolster repeatability and efficiency.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Trend #4:  Intervention Guidance
 </h4>
 <p>
  Those in the healthcare field will tell you that needle guidance is among the more procedurally frustrating aspects of their jobs. On average, three attempts are required to successfully find an artery/vein and insert the needle, and failure isn’t as innocuous as you may believe. It can lead to hematomas, nerve damage, or infection. Ultrasound is quickly becoming an established instrument for vessel localization, and emerging companion software, including augmented reality visualization systems, are being developed to further simplify this procedure.

 <p>
  For the full potential of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to be realized, it must be treated as a new modality, not simply as an inexpensive, portable ultrasound system. POCUS must involve automated data analyses, rugged hardware, and specialized interfaces to guide novice users to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe, gather high-quality data, and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of a POCUS system should typically be quantitative measures and easy-to-understand reformulations of the acquired data, not B-mode images; it should be assumed that the expertise needed to interpret B-mode images will not be readily available at point-of-care. Example POCUS applications include detection of intra-abdominal bleeding by EMS personnel for patient triage at the scene of an accident, diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure by medics using the computer-assisted measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter, and monitoring of liver tissue health in the homes of at-risk patients.

  The extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (E-FAST) exam is a means to triage patients who may have a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) or internal bleeding due to abdominal trauma. By assessing select areas on the patient’s body with ultrasound, valuable information is provided that can help determine whether a patient is destined for observation, CT scanning, or the operating room. Unfortunately, while the cost of portable ultrasound systems continues to drop, the training required remains a major hurdle. Studies have shown that E-FAST is effective in pre-hospital settings
  <a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" style="background-color: #ffffff;" title="">
   [2]
  </a>
  ; however those studies have involved physicians and surgeons with up to 100 hours of specialized E-FAST training, and such extensive training isn’t practical for typical EMS personnel. The reality is that it has been estimated that the rate of preventable trauma-related deaths is 85% higher in rural populations than in urban populations
  <a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" style="background-color: #ffffff;" title="">
   [3]
  </a>
  , with pre-hospital patient care being an urgent and unmet need in rural and under-served populations [

   Trauma.org
  </a>
  ].
 </p>
 <p>
  What can be done to bring the powerful diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound to the masses at the scene of accidents and natural catastrophes? Kitware is helping to spur the widespread adoption of trauma-focused ultrasonography by creating a portable and easy-to-use system that integrates (1) advanced machine learning methods with (2) low-cost ultrasound probes from
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-and-interson-partner-to-facilitate-portable-ultrasound/">
   Interson
  </a>
  and (3) innovative augmented reality displays from

   InnerOptic
  </a>
  . Aspects of this effort are being funded by the NIH and spearheaded by clinical collaborators in Trauma Surgery and Emergency Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis and at Duke University in North Carolina.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our work in this area has also been extended to include the in-field assessment of
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/traumatic-brain-injury-assessment-automating-optic-nerve-sheath-diameter-estimation/">
   traumatic brain injury (TBI)

  , a pre-clinical ultrasound startup, Kitware is participating in the development of tools and technologies to help cancer researchers track tumors in animal models. One biomarker of cancer malignancy is tortuosity of vessels within the tumor—an indicator of how well the tumor is nourished. One goal of our collaboration is to monitor tumor vessels with high-frequency ultrasound and advanced image-analysis algorithms, enabling researchers to investigate how tumors respond to potential anti-cancer drugs. This project is funded by the NIH and NSF, with grants to Kitware, UNC, and SonoVol. Once realized, this approach will facilitate drug development and help researchers in academia and industry identify promising therapies earlier.

  One particularly innovative aspect of the system is that it provides guidance to the clinician via an integrated pico projector that displays the location of the vein and needle guidance instructions directly on the patient’s skin. Once fully developed, this will bring subcutaneous anatomy and instruments to the surface, making imprecise needle sticks a thing of the past.  Collaborators for this project are Interson, InnerOptic, Duke University, and Washington University in St. Louis.
