  A group of researchers in industry, academia and the DOE national labs, including Andrew Bauer, Berk Geveci and Patrick O’Leary from Kitware, recently submitted a State-of-the-Art Report (STAR) to

  methods which was accepted for publication. The abstract for the paper is:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The considerable interest in the high performance computing (HPC) community regarding analyzing and visualization data without first writing to disk, i.e.,
   <em>
    in situ
   </em>
   processing, is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first storing to a filesystem. Second is the potential for increased accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available resources, CPU’s and accelerators, in the computation of analysis products. This STAR paper brings together researchers, developers and practitioners using
   <em>
    in situ
   </em>
   methods in extreme-scale HPC with the goal to present existing methods, infrastructures, and a range of computational science and engineering applications using in situ analysis and
   <br/>
   visualization.

  Additionally, as part of the Eurovis 2016 conference, E. Wes Bethel from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will be presenting the paper during the ST2: Distributed Visualization session on Wednesday, June 8th, 11:00-12:40 in Lower Room 1.
