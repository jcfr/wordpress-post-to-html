  The pragmatic rule: That it is good for your survival to be nice to others,
  <br/>
  is particularly true when you live in a society where cooperation increases
  <br/>
  your chances of being alive tomorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this context, Niceness arises not out of a moral imperative but out of
  <br/>
  rational and practical self-interest. A concept that today is known as:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest">
   Enlightened Self-Interest
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is better understood by thinking about Self-Interest in
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/grateful-dead-business-lessons/">
   the long term
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  or as Robert Axelrod put it: by considering
  <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/nice-provocable-forgiving-and-clear/">
   The Shadow of the Future
  </a>
  ,
  <br/>
  when we make decisions about whether we cooperate with others or not.

  This is something that struck the Frenchman
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville">
   Alexis de Tocqueville
  </a>
  when
  <br/>
  he was writing his observations about
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America">
   Democracy in America
  </a>
  in 1836.
  <br/>
  In
  <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/ch2_08.htm">
   his chapter
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  “How the Americans Combat Individualism
  <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/ch2_08.htm">
   <br/>
  </a>
  by the Principle of Self-Interest Rightly Understood”
 </p>
 <p>
  He wrote
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “..and it is held as a truth that man serves himself in serving
   <br/>
  </em>
  <em>
   his fellow creatures and that his private interest is to do good”
   <br/>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Benjamin Franklin put it in a shorter form as:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Do Well, by Doing Good”
  </em>
