  further analyses the significance of the announcement:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    “Firstly
   </strong>
   , the European Commission will lead the way
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   by
   <strong>
    pioneering open data policies and practises
   </strong>
   that
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   it would like to see adopted by EU member states.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   <strong>
    “Eating your own dogfood”,
   </strong>
   as software developers
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   affectionately call it.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   They will open up documents and datasets from
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   across dozens of institutions
  </em>
  “
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “
   <strong>
    Secondly
   </strong>
   the Commission will put up
   <strong>
    €100 million
   </strong>
   <br/>
   in financial support for research into “data-handling
   <br/>
   technologies”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The European initiative include legislation proposals
  <br/>
  for making data “
  <strong>
   Open by Default
  </strong>
  “:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “…An ‘open by default’ rule for all ‘public documents’
   <br/>
   which will mean that they “can be re-used for any
   <br/>
   purpose, commercial or non-commercial”.
   <br/>
   Though this isn’t spelled out, ‘documents’ is probably
   <br/>
   intended in a broad sense to cover datasets, as in the
   <br/>
   current text of the Directive. The basic message is:
   <br/>
   ‘if you can make it public, it should be open for everyone
   <br/>
   to reuse’.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The announcement included a call to
  <strong>
   immediate
  </strong>
  action
  <br/>
  for embracing

  <br/>
  importance.
